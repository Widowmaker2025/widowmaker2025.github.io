        <content type="html" xml:base="https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/archiving-gradience/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo by &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unsplash.com&#x2F;@imclyde&quot;&gt;Clyde RS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unsplash.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;clouds-under-clear-blue-sky-during-daytime-4XbZCfU2Uoo&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;small&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;backstory&quot;&gt;Backstory&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago today, a project called AdwCustomizer emerged; a libadwaita app that allowed users to recolor their libadwaita and GTK3 apps (if the &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lassekongo83&#x2F;adw-gtk3&quot;&gt;adw-gtk3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; theme was present) using an easy-to-use interface.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;markdown-alert-important&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stance on theming hasn’t changed; I still believe that distributions should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ship theming out of the box. It’s up to the user to decide whether or not they are comfortable with broken applications. See &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stopthemingmy.app&quot;&gt;“please don’t theme our apps”&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;markdown-alert-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve stopped theming my desktop for a while; I’ve been using vanilla GNOME for about a year now, with only a few extensions that add some missing features that I really need, like automatic dark mode at sunset.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was absolutely thrilled to be one of the first to discover this amazing app! I had been thinking about such an app literally just a few days prior to this. I even posted about this app on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;gnome&#x2F;comments&#x2F;w2ehe2&#x2F;libadwaita_and_adwgtk3_recoloring_demo_using&#x2F;&quot;&gt;r&#x2F;gnome&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-contributions&quot;&gt;First Contributions&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, I opened an issue regarding the project name and its change, since it didn’t follow the &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.gnome.org&#x2F;hig&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;app-naming.html&quot;&gt;GNOME HIG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ArtyIF&quot;&gt;ArtyIF&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;–developer of the project–quickly responded, stating that the suggested “Adwaita Manager” sounded quite good, and very soon, the project was renamed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I created an issue about the app’s icon and even tried to design something (in retrospect: the icon turned out to be utter shit, just like every other icon at the time), got into a little heated argument with another designer, and even did some UI mockups (which, you guessed it, looked like shit).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-duty&quot;&gt;New Duty&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then something unexpected happened: the developer announced that he was looking for a new (co-)maintainer. This was shocking to me because I really liked the project, so I did what any reasonable human being would do: commented that I would like to maintain it, and no, I didn’t say that I’m not a programmer and a joke of a designer…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, I took responsibility into my own hands and… made an announcement on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;gnome&#x2F;&quot;&gt;r&#x2F;gnome&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;linux&#x2F;&quot;&gt;r&#x2F;linux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that the project was looking for a maintainer. Without asking ArtyIF first. &lt;em&gt;Deep sigh&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; somebody kill me, please.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one came to maintain it from the Reddit post, but one guy commented under the initial developer’s announcement on GitHub Discussions and said he would like to maintain it. And so, this guy and I were soon added to the “AdwCustomizer Team” GitHub organization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, we continued to work on the project; the new maintainer implemented many of the requested features, such as Material You preset generation and refreshed the UI (following my mockups).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rename-in-progress&quot;&gt;Rename in Progress&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, the app was somewhat feature complete, and with the help of &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lyessaadi&quot;&gt;Lyes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; we finally managed to upload it to Flathub (we hadn’t done so before because Gradience used newly added liabdwaita message dialog widgets that weren’t available in the stable release), so we did some thinking and decided to post an announcement about it on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thisweek.gnome.org&quot;&gt;TWIG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Shortly after the TWIG post, one of the GNOME designers contacted me and asked if the project could use a name that wouldn’t be confused with an official GNOME app.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archiving-gradience&#x2F;rename-request.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rename request.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot of the chat with the GNOME designer asking about the renaming&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this makes perfect sense, but at the time I was… offended? Anyhow, I promptly opened a new discussion on GitHub and we started brainstorming the new name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was, um, dumber and didn’t understand English well enough, it was an awkward experience. In the end, we came up with a couple of names, and ArtyIF suggested one more; Gradience. And so, we posted a Reddit poll for people to decide which one we should use. And the people chose… Gradience!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, being a dumb fuck, I really disliked the name, but people chose it, so there wasn’t much I could do about it. Eventually I realized it’s freaking perfect. Good thing it wasn’t changed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promptly, we renamed all instances of Adwaita Manager in the project, and then moved the GitHub organization to the new name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;growing-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Growing Responsibilities&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passed, new features were added, I designed more UI mockups, icons, translated the project into Russian, spent a lot of time in the projects chat, and overall got deeply involved in the project. Gradually more power and responsibility was put on my shoulders, but I didn’t complain, since it’s cool to “maintain” a big project, r-right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-beginning-of-an-end&quot;&gt;The Beginning of an End&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New versions of GNOME came out, more and more presets (just a fancy name for Gradience color themes) were created, the app got more polished and powerful, someone contributed some legitimately great stuff, like GNOME Shell theming and backend rework, but otherwise, there wasn’t much contributions from the outside. Then all of a sudden… the maintainer disappeared.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn’t happen suddenly, but gradually.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time later, the maintainer disappeared completely, and I was left alone to triage the issue tracker and answer all the questions in the support forum (there were lots, lots of them). I began to dislike all of this, and eventually burned out completely and simply muted all Gradience chats. I’d still come over and answer a question or two, but I really didn’t want to spend my time there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of February of this year, the maintainer came back from his long hiatus and said that he would try to see what had happened in the last few months and build a roadmap for the next few months. As well as focus on the backend by fixing all the major performance issues, bugs and implementing what was discussed a few months ago and, and then take care of the UI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five months later and no work has been done whatsoever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end&quot;&gt;The End&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood that this couldn’t go on forever. People &lt;em&gt;will&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; keep asking the same questions, they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; keep asking for the new release date, and I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; keep having to answer them. To be fair, some people did the work for me and answered those questions, so it wasn’t quite as bad (you know who you are, thanks!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app was last updated over a year ago, and the new release wasn’t ready, we just did a beta release to test the WIP GNOME Shell theming, so it was left at this &lt;code&gt;0.8.0-beta1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; position.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I scraped up all the courage and the remaining social battery and did what I had been planning to do for a while; announced that the project was looking for a new maintainer. Again. Just like the first time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just like the first time, no one responded in two weeks, so I did what I had been thinking about and what one Reddit comment suggested: archived the project, the entire GitHub organization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archiving-gradience&#x2F;archived-organization.png&quot; alt=&quot;Archived Gradience organization.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;farewell&quot;&gt;Farewell&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? In short, there will be no further updates, and I will have a solid answer to all the questions that will be asked in the support forums.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that I finally did it and that this weight has been lifted from my shoulders (to some extent), but I also feel kind of bad and sad about it. After all, this project has indirectly allowed me to meet a lot of wonderful people, communities, and overall become a better me. Gradience and its community will forever be in my heart, thank you all for these wonderful two years ^^&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Gradience’s off-topic “Water Cooler” room; it’s such a nice place to chat with cool people about whatever you want (it’s still there, by the way &lt;em&gt;wink-wink, nudge-nudge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end. For now. Goodbye, Gradience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archiving-gradience&#x2F;saluting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Saluting.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archiving-gradience&#x2F;shell-preview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shell preview.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha, no.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought so at the moment of writing the early draft. There’s some promising work being done by one of my friends, it’s still in the early stages, but I’m looking forward to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is it? You gave us the most ambiguous description one could possibly come up with!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay okay! It’s a rewrite of Gradience, you ready? in Rust. Called Chameleon. You satisfied?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some other things happening behind the scenes, but I can’t say much just yet :P&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that we are on a positive note, I can say: see you next time!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/not-that-latitude/">&lt;blockquote class=&quot;markdown-alert-fact&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It was quite hard to get the expressions right, &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daudix&#x2F;daudix.one&#x2F;blob&#x2F;6fe0769435516a0b3a4818592a8d5ab47d7b3db4&#x2F;content&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;header.png&quot;&gt;first version&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had them very sadge, so I changed them to be a bit more restrained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;backstory&quot;&gt;Backstory&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;macboy-chronicles&#x2F;&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, my previous laptop passed away recently and I got a new one to replace it. I teased that I would tell more about it in the next post, and well, this is that post :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clears throat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; alright, where did we stop last time… &lt;em&gt;paper noises&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, aha!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning the unneeded parts, we got back $110, which was a good starting point for saving up for the next laptop. Why a laptop and not a PC? As silly as it sounds, I simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sit in the same spot for longer than 10 minutes, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; if that spot is a desk, so a laptop is a requirement, not a choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boring money saving later, we (me, Mom, and later on Dad) started the search. Initially, we searched for ThinkPads since &lt;del&gt;ThinkPad cult members&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; people say they are very durable, upgradable, have good Linux support, and overall they are the best thing in the world (to be fair they do look badass).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few listings and some &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&quot;&gt;Notebookcheck&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; review reading later, it became clear that virtually all ThinkPads in the desired price category (~$210) suffer from the same issue: sRGB coverage around 56%. This isn’t a big deal if the only thing you do is write reports in Microsoft Word and scroll through Facebook memes, but it’s crucial if you do even basic design work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to look at Dell; my Mom had a Dell laptop before and it was a good machine. After scrolling through all listings from our city and checking every single one of them on Notebookcheck for the sRGB coverage, it became clear that the situation was somewhat similar to ThinkPads, but there was one listing that was interesting… (I’ve skipped the boring false positives).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell Latitude E7470 - 2017 ultrabook in great condition, with decent specs, and, most importantly, 96% sRGB coverage (at least so I thought)! MacBoy had full sRGB coverage, but still, it was very close, and comparing it to other laptops with 56% coverage it was the best variant. The price was sane as well: $230.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;latitude-closed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Latitude closed.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Feels good to hold a laptop that is twice as thin and light as MacBoy&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;latitude-open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Latitude open.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Even though its screen is 14 inches it&#x27;s just as compact as MacBoy; thin bezels compensate the screen size&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-s-time&quot;&gt;It’s Time&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day - 5th of June - while I was asleep, Mom told Dad about this variant, and he promptly called the seller to not miss such an opportunity. He asked if the machine in the listing was the same one, and it was indeed the same machine and all was OK, so he agreed on the purchase and delivery (which was free) the same day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up only to hear the surprising like snow-in-the-summer news, and I was happy and nervous at the same time—hapvous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours of painful sociophobic waiting later, the seller finally called me (since Dad already went to work) that he was on the way and would arrive within an hour. An hour later he called me again to say he had arrived at our place. I went out, took a deep breath, took the briefcase with the laptop from the seller’s car trunk, opened it, took out the laptop, opened it, gave it a quick glance just to make sure it wasn’t an empty chassis or in an unacceptable state (I was super nervous so I didn’t even check if the model was the right one), said “y-yeah all good, hopefully”, gave the money and &lt;del&gt;rushed&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; headed home at a steady pace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being excited, I turned the laptop on, disgusted by Windows and its awful design, scrolling, ads in the start menu—&lt;em&gt;distant cough&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; oh yeah, I got a little carried away. I went to YouTube and searched for “Costa Rica HDR” and turned &lt;em&gt;that one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; video on, doing the same on Mom’s Sony Vaio that I used for the last year. And something unexpected happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-fly-in-the-ointment&quot;&gt;A Fly in the Ointment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ready? &lt;em&gt;sighs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; The screen turned out to be dogshit. Yes, the very reason why I dismissed all the nice ThinkPads and Dells. I mean, I’m grateful and all, but it’s not even close to 96% sRGB; heck, it’s even slightly less saturated than the bootleg replacement screen on said Sony Vaio!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed and saddened, another “yes, but-” moment, all the searching was pointless as I could’ve got the first powerful ThinkPad for the same price, since the screen is the same level shit anyways, but it was late for the smart thoughts, so I just went along with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial detail that I didn’t give enough attention to is the fact that the Latitude in Notebookcheck was the high-end configuration; with the 4K touch screen, fingerprint scanner, and Intel Core i7 instead of i5 like in my unit. For some reason, I thought that the only difference between the touch 4K version and the FHD matte screen version was the resolution and the absence of, you know, the touch, but no, only the touch screen version has good color accuracy. The ones with matte screens (1920x1080 and 1366x768) have a generic sRGB coverage for this type of laptop - 50-something percent (for some reason there’s virtually no reviews for these versions, so no exact numbers). My ignorance has played a bad trick against me once again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered that closing the lid doesn’t put it in sleep mode. I thought it was a Windows issue, so I didn’t give it much attention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad things aside, I flashed a new Fedora Silverblue USB and installed it, which was an absolute breeze; no need to install &lt;code&gt;broadcom-wl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to get the WiFi working, no need for RPM Fusion for &lt;code&gt;broadcom-wl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and all the trickery needed to enable it on Silverblue, no need to add &lt;code&gt;acpi_backlight=auto&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; kernel argument to make the minimal screen brightness not burn your eyes, everything “just worked” out of the box. I knew Dell shipped some laptops with Linux and they’re (way) more Linux-friendly than Apple, but damn, I didn’t expect it to be this good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;neowofetch.png#transparent&quot; alt=&quot;neowofetch.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;How can one talk about a new laptop with Linux installed and not show a &lt;del&gt;neofetch&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; neowofetch screenshot!?&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation, I opened Software to update the system, and… BIOS AND FIRMWARE UPDATES!? Fwupd is good huh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I opened Settings to check the Device Security tab, just for fun and giggles, and IT’S ALL GREEN!? On MacBoy it was all red, since no secure boot and such.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to watch some videos, connected the headphones and A HEADPHONE TYPE SELECTOR POPPED OUT!? MacBoy didn’t have this as well, it was a headset all the time. Here, on the other hand, I can connect it as headphones, a headset, or just a microphone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used it for hours moving data from Vaio and MacBoy, and the battery didn’t drain. I can do 3 hours of work and watch some YouTube videos and it will still have 20% left. I still can’t get used to it after two weeks, it feels so good after the absence of battery and constant issues with the charger.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard has a longer travel distance than MacBoy and doesn’t have the slight key drift that makes keys make an annoying sound. It feels so good to write blog posts on it. The touchpad is decent as well, not the same glass trackpad though, it has a bit harsh scrolling (in the sense that it doesn’t scroll pixel by pixel but rather 2-3 pixels at a time) and it doesn’t click, meaning I need to either tap to click or use the dedicated buttons, which are present on both top and bottom of the touchpad at least. It still annoys me a little even 2 weeks later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One brand new thing for me was the trackpoint. This thing was so weird and confusing at first, but I slowly started to get it. It’s super useful in Blender and, to my surprise, Portal 2 :3&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these little things made my mood better and I no longer regretted the purchase. Sure, the screen wasn’t the one I wanted, sleep on closed lid doesn’t work since apparently the bezel was replaced and the magnet in it is absent and there’s no “Dell” typed on it, soft touch plastic collects all the dust and fingerprints by just looking at it and is constantly sticky no matter what you do, but it’s not critical.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; this laptop. MacBoy was a good machine, but this one is a whole new level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. While making the final edits to this post I’ve come up with a name for Latitude - Latte!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. The next post is already in the drafts, and it will be about my switch to a dumbphone or how my Pixel 3 burned violently without warning. (You can never have too many stories about my devices dying, right?)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
