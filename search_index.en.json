What I liked about it is that it’s more lightweight yet has more features than Mastodon, even the glitch-soc edition (e.g. it can render MFM-Misskey Flavoured Markdown), plus it has slightly skeuomorphic look.\nI wasn’t sure if I should switch my home server from treehouse or keep it as a backup, but then I thought “what if I keep my current main profile for the boring David and use the new instance for Daudix’s needs?”, and… I did it! and this is the official announcement, if you want to follow the new profile it is at https://pleroma.envs.net/users/daudix (Seirdy, the instance admin, rocks btw).\nSometimes I might boost stuff from this new profile on the main, but otherwise I expect the main to be less active.\nI still don’t quite understand the relationship between Akkoma and Pleroma; they look just as maintained to me, but I guess there was a reason ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nOh and one more thing: why not *key!!!

It’s up to the user to decide whether or not they are comfortable with broken applications. See “please don’t theme our apps”.\n\n\nPersonally, I’ve stopped theming my desktop for a while; I’ve been using vanilla GNOME for about a year now, with only a few extensions that add some missing features that I really need, like automatic dark mode at sunset.\n\nI was absolutely thrilled to be one of the first to discover this amazing app! I had been thinking about such an app literally just a few days prior to this. I even posted about this app on r/gnome.\nFirst Contributions\nThe same day, I opened an issue regarding the project name and its change, since it didn’t follow the GNOME HIG. ArtyIF–developer of the project–quickly responded, stating that the suggested “Adwaita Manager” sounded quite good, and very soon, the project was renamed.\nThen I created an issue about the app’s icon and even tried to design something (in retrospect: the icon turned out to be utter shit, just like every other icon at the time), got into a little heated argument with another designer, and even did some UI mockups (which, you guessed it, looked like shit).\nNew Duty\nThen something unexpected happened: the developer announced that he was looking for a new (co-)maintainer. This was shocking to me because I really liked the project, so I did what any reasonable human being would do: commented that I would like to maintain it, and no, I didn’t say that I’m not a programmer and a joke of a designer…\nTo make things worse, I took responsibility into my own hands and… made an announcement on r/gnome and r/linux that the project was looking for a maintainer. Without asking ArtyIF first. Deep sigh somebody kill me, please.\nNo one came to maintain it from the Reddit post, but one guy commented under the initial developer’s announcement on GitHub Discussions and said he would like to maintain it. And so, this guy and I were soon added to the “AdwCustomizer Team” GitHub organization.\nSince then, we continued to work on the project; the new maintainer implemented many of the requested features, such as Material You preset generation and refreshed the UI (following my mockups).\nRename in Progress\nA month later, the app was somewhat feature complete, and with the help of Lyes we finally managed to upload it to Flathub (we hadn’t done so before because Gradience used newly added liabdwaita message dialog widgets that weren’t available in the stable release), so we did some thinking and decided to post an announcement about it on TWIG. Shortly after the TWIG post, one of the GNOME designers contacted me and asked if the project could use a name that wouldn’t be confused with an official GNOME app.\n\n\nScreenshot of the chat with the GNOME designer asking about the renaming\n\nIn retrospect, this makes perfect sense, but at the time I was… offended? Anyhow, I promptly opened a new discussion on GitHub and we started brainstorming the new name.\nSince I was, um, dumber and didn’t understand English well enough, it was an awkward experience. In the end, we came up with a couple of names, and ArtyIF suggested one more; Gradience. And so, we posted a Reddit poll for people to decide which one we should use. And the people chose… Gradience!\nAgain, being a dumb fuck, I really disliked the name, but people chose it, so there wasn’t much I could do about it. Eventually I realized it’s freaking perfect. Good thing it wasn’t changed.\nPromptly, we renamed all instances of Adwaita Manager in the project, and then moved the GitHub organization to the new name.\nGrowing Responsibilities\nTime passed, new features were added, I designed more UI mockups, icons, translated the project into Russian, spent a lot of time in the projects chat, and overall got deeply involved in the project. Gradually more power and responsibility was put on my shoulders, but I didn’t complain, since it’s cool to “maintain” a big project, r-right?\nThe Beginning of an End\nNew versions of GNOME came out, more and more presets (just a fancy name for Gradience color themes) were created, the app got more polished and powerful, someone contributed some legitimately great stuff, like GNOME Shell theming and backend rework, but otherwise, there wasn’t much contributions from the outside. Then all of a sudden… the maintainer disappeared.\nWell, it didn’t happen suddenly, but gradually.\nSome time later, the maintainer disappeared completely, and I was left alone to triage the issue tracker and answer all the questions in the support forum (there were lots, lots of them). I began to dislike all of this, and eventually burned out completely and simply muted all Gradience chats. I’d still come over and answer a question or two, but I really didn’t want to spend my time there.\nAt the end of February of this year, the maintainer came back from his long hiatus and said that he would try to see what had happened in the last few months and build a roadmap for the next few months. As well as focus on the backend by fixing all the major performance issues, bugs and implementing what was discussed a few months ago and, and then take care of the UI.\nFive months later and no work has been done whatsoever.\nThe End\nI understood that this couldn’t go on forever. People will keep asking the same questions, they will keep asking for the new release date, and I will keep having to answer them. To be fair, some people did the work for me and answered those questions, so it wasn’t quite as bad (you know who you are, thanks!).\nThe app was last updated over a year ago, and the new release wasn’t ready, we just did a beta release to test the WIP GNOME Shell theming, so it was left at this 0.8.0-beta1 position.\nLast month, I scraped up all the courage and the remaining social battery and did what I had been planning to do for a while; announced that the project was looking for a new maintainer. Again. Just like the first time.\nBut just like the first time, no one responded in two weeks, so I did what I had been thinking about and what one Reddit comment suggested: archived the project, the entire GitHub organization.\n\nFarewell\nWhat does this mean? In short, there will be no further updates, and I will have a solid answer to all the questions that will be asked in the support forums.\nI’m glad that I finally did it and that this weight has been lifted from my shoulders (to some extent), but I also feel kind of bad and sad about it. After all, this project has indirectly allowed me to meet a lot of wonderful people, communities, and overall become a better me. Gradience and its community will forever be in my heart, thank you all for these wonderful two years ^^\nSpecial thanks to Gradience’s off-topic “Water Cooler” room; it’s such a nice place to chat with cool people about whatever you want (it’s still there, by the way wink-wink, nudge-nudge).\nThis is the end. For now. Goodbye, Gradience.\n\n\nHa, no.\nI thought so at the moment of writing the early draft. There’s some promising work being done by one of my friends, it’s still in the early stages, but I’m looking forward to it.\nWhat is it? You gave us the most ambiguous description one could possibly come up with!\nOkay okay! It’s a rewrite of Gradience, you ready? in Rust. Called Chameleon.

It’s fun, quite fun, and honestly, pretty fun. I won’t go into the backstory of the logotar, though, because it’s outside the scope of this article and it looked like absolute crap, so… WAIT WHAT-\nSounds of bones being crushed with 2 tons of plush.\nOkay, fiiine.\nBackstory\n\nA while back, back in August 2019, when I didn’t have back pain (just kidding), my mom and I drew this logotar on an iPad 2. It’s not spectacular by any means, but it’s important to me because, well, we drew it with my mom, it’s my first logotar, and it captures things I like, like Lego and… yeah, that’s it. I was even more boring and annoying than I am now. And damn, that UFO suffix really, really sucked…\n\nFast forward unknown amount of time when I learned of the existence of Canva, in which I “made” this logotar; by “made” I mean I found this stock metaball thingy and colored it in this blue gradient. (there were earlier versions, but they were just ugly because they had a little “DAUDIX UFO” text underneath the blob, which used uglier shades of blue; BSOD-level ugly blue)\nI used this logotar for a while, until-\nCold Boot\nRelated: Animation of it on YouTube.\nThat’s right, it’s a bold reference to a Portal 2 chapter with the same name, who might’ve guessed ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nAnyway, what I was talki- I mean writing about? Oh yeah, the logotar. One day I was visiting the GNOME OS website and I saw this very cool illustration and I really liked the way the purple-blue gradient looked, and I did what I do when I like something. STOLE IT. Rehehehe\n.\n\nYeah, that’s where this gradient and the whole idea of redesigning my logotar came from. As silly as it sounds.\nI’ve been using this logotar for a while, and still do, but a few days ago I felt like trying something new, something that’s been on my to-do list for like forever.\nExperiments\nTL;DR: Here’s the results of my experiments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, a bit about each of them (in the order in which the logotars appear):\n\nBubbles: A while ago I did a silly experiment where I remade my logotar in Blender using real metaballs, and it turned out pretty decent; I even used it for a day or two on Mastodon. Since I still had the .blend file on my PC, I thought why not try to create something I had been wanting to do for a while–soap bubbles! (shout out to this tutorial for the bubble material)\nCandy: Had some fun with layer blend modes that turned into this skeuomorphic tasty-looking thing. See those “rays” in the background? I like rays like that :P\nDéjà Vu: Reimagining of my current logotar; quite familiar and yet different in some way.\nMesh: Boldly inspired by this elementaryOS logo. What I like about it is that it doesn’t use purple exclusively, but rather a spectrum of colors taken from the Monokai Pro palette; the same colors used in the rainbow strip on the Polaroid picture on the homepage. For me it’s kind of important, because I don’t want my next logotar to stop me from changing my “brand color”, if that makes sense. I’m pretty fed up with the current Purple 2 to be honest. What’s complicated about not being tied to a single color is that I have no idea what to do with things like my 88x31 button.\nMesh (alt): Ditto, but inverted(?). I don’t like it because it’s a little too colorful for my taste.\nMono: The laziest and most recent experiment, if you can even call it that.\n\nAbout Bubbles; I went even further and made this shitty animation, again just for fun and I didn’t put much effort into it. (I say that so you don’t think I’m that shitty animator)\n\nYou might’ve noticed the Mesh variant already being used on Matrix and Déjà Vu on Mastodon and Bluesky, what does that mean?\nWell, nothing really, I just throw logotars on profiles and see what sticks.\nLooking away that didn’t sound very professional.\nI meant to say that I conduct an A/B testing in the real world scenarios to determine which logotar variant fulfills the desired objectives better.\n\n\tSilly me just realized that the blueprint logo I made for the banner is actually another experiment! I might explore this direction further, I’m pretty sure it’ll look swag in purple.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThat’s about it, this was supposed to be a short and silly article that was supposed to be published the following day after I created these logotars, but I was constantly distracted from writing and ended up finishing it five days later. So… yeah, see you in the next one ^^\nP.S.

If not, check the following guide by GitHub on setting up Git and Zola’s documentation on installing it.\nWhat Is Codeberg?\nCodeberg is a free forge for free and open source projects. A forge is a web-based collaborative software platform for both developing and sharing various software projects.\nYou may be familiar with GitHub, and well, it’s pretty much the same thing, except it doesn’t compromise user privacy, it doesn’t violate license agreements, and it doesn’t train its AI on code that users host there. I moved away from GitHub myself some time ago, and have no regrets.\nSee Give Up GitHub! and Please don’t upload my code to GitHub to get a better understanding of why GitHub is bad.\nSign up on Codeberg\nThis one is pretty straightforward, you just go to codeberg.org and press that big “Register now.” button. The rest is self-explanatory.\n\nCreate the Repository\nNow you can create a repository for your website. A repository is like a public folder with your project that you and others can work on.\n\nNow name the repository pages if you don’t plan on using custom domain, otherwise you need to choose a different name, e.g. website. That’s because Codeberg pages don’t work well with custom domains and pages repository with the pages branch. It’s confusing so just know that such combo won’t work.\n\nI also recommend checking this “Initialize repository” box to save some time later.\n\nNow you can go and smash that “Create repository” button and proceed to the next step.\nInitializing Zola Website\nTo be completely unbiased, I will use my own Duckquill Zola theme in this example \nJokes aside, you can use any theme from getzola.org/themes, but to make sure we’re on the same page we’ll use Duckquill.\nFirst, clone the newly created repository and then cd into it.\n\nThen, initialize a new Zola site with zola init --force. You can simply spam Enter ↵ since we’ll use our own configuration anyway. (The reason why the --force flag is used is that Zola doesn’t like the presence of Git files in the folder and doesn’t want to proceed otherwise)\nNow you’ll need to add the Duckquill theme as a Git submodule:\n\nA Git submodule is a repository inside another repository. When you add a submodule, Git adds it to a special .gitmodules file, which can then be read by Git somewhere else and clone the needed repository in place, which will be helpful later when we set up the CI workflow.\n\n\nNow we need to switch to the latest release instead of the unstable main branch:\n\n\nYou can check the latest release here: https://codeberg.org/daudix/duckquill/releases\n\nNow you can try serving the site locally:\n\n\nHm, doesn’t look quite right…\nThat’s because we first need to add some bare-bones configuration to config.toml:\n\nAnd let’s create a homepage by creating an _index.md file under content with the following contents:\n\nAnd we get…\n\nAlright, perhaps our config is too bare-bones, let’s enable navbar and a footer:\n\nAnd add something to the homepage:\n\n\nMuch better. You can customize it further by looking at Duckquill’s config.\nNow we can push the changes to Codeberg and set up the CI to build and deploy our site to Codeberg pages.\nSetting up the CI\n\nBefore we get to setting up the CI, we first need to get access to it. You’ll need to fill the following form at Codeberg-e.V./requests repository and wait for approval. After your request been approved, we can proceed further.\n\nCopy the following Woodpecker workflow example from Codeberg-CI/examples and put it in the .woodpecker.yaml file in the root of your project. If you want the CI to be able to run manually, add manual to steps that have the push events in them.\n\nPush the changes and go to ci.codeberg.org. There, add the pages repository we created earlier:\n\n\n\nNow, create a secret on Codeberg so CI can push the changes. You need to set the repository scope to Read and write.\n\nCopy and paste the resulting token somewhere, since it couldn’t be seen after the page reload.\nNow add the needed secrets in the Woodpecker repository settings by clicking on the repository in the list:\n\nNavigate to the “Secrets” tab:\n\nAdd secret with the name mail with email you used for Codeberg as the value, with the Push and Manual events selected (the later is only needed if you added manual event in the CI file):\n\n\nDo the same for the codeberg_token, use the token we generated earlier as the value.\nWe’re almost there! now we just need to create the pages branch on Codeberg where the build result will be pushed:\n\nNow we can run the first build by pressing the “Run pipeline” button in Woodpecker.\nIf everything is done properly, the build should succeed and site be available on &lt;username&gt;.codeberg.page.\nConclusion\nCongrats!\n You are now officially a web citizen! Show off your new site to the world; it’s something to be proud of! Since it’s yours and yours alone, you can do whatever you want with it; add silly gags all over the place, write serious or not-so-serious articles, let it rot for eternity, you name it!\nIf you run into problems or need help with any of the steps, feel free to reach out, I will try my best to help ^^\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/deploying-to-codeberg-pages/","title":"Deploying a Zola Website to Codeberg Pages"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/downloading-deleted-unsplash-photos/":{"body":"Backstory\nI was making a banner for the Codeberg Pages post and wanted to use the same mountain image as on the Codeberg landing page.

Unfortunately, the page returned a 404.\n\nAll I had to do was right-click and open the last Wayback Machine snapshot.\n\nObviously, the download buttons didn’t work, so I visited the photo author’s Unsplash profile, but it returned a placeholder, so I used the one archived by Wayback Machine.\n\nUnfortunately, his website didn’t have the photo I needed, so I had to use what I had: the thumbnail; its size was fine for the banner, so I went ahead and used it.\n\nBut the fact that a low quality thumbnail was used for the banner kept bothering me, so I decided to locate the source.\nUpon inspecting the link to the thumbnail image on Unsplash, I noticed that you can change some of its attributes to get a higher quality image, so I returned to the mountain photo snapshot and copied the link to it, removed the Wayback Machine prefix, and to my surprise it was still available, probably because images.unsplash.com keeps the deleted images anyway to avoid breaking hotlinks.\nThe solution\nSo what’s the perfect combination of link attributes to get the original image? It’s ?auto=format&amp;q=100, these individually won’t return the original image, but together they will.\nThe resulting URL should look like this, without all the extra stuff like site tracking.\n\nThe solution, as you guessed, requires the existence of at least one Wayback Machine snapshot with the thumbnail; if there is no such snapshot, this hack won’t work because the images.unsplash.com image ID is different from the one on unsplash.com.

As Gemini protocol are much easier than web, there are a lot of browsers for it, some good ones are:\n\nLagrange (Cross-platform) - Beautiful, fast and customizable Gemini browser\nGeopard (Linux) - Colorful and adaptive Libadwaita Gemini browser written in Rust\nBuran (Android) - Simple Gemini browser for Android\nElaho (iOS) - Simple Gemini browser for iOS\nAmfora (Terminal) - Fancy Gemini browser for terminal\n\nOr, if you don’t want to install a separate browser for Gemini or just want to quickly look over some capsule, you can use Gemini to web proxy, such as portal.mozz.us\nBrowsing Geminispace\nYou can start browsing Geminispace by looking over some capsules at various aggregators:\n\ngemini.circumlunar.space/capcom\nrawtext.club:1965/~sloum/spacewalk.gmi\ncalcuode.com/gmisub-aggregate.gmi\n\nGemini also has its own search - geminispace.info\nI have found some interesting capsules you might like to look at:\n\nchat.mozz.us - Unmoderated chat for everyone\nstation.martinrue.com - Gemini social media\ncosmic.voyage - Tilde community based around a collaborative science-fiction universe\nskyjake.fi - Lagrange developers capsule\nAnd more to be found ;)\n\nCreating Own Capsule\nYou can start by getting your own Gemini capsule (a website in Geminispace), there are multiple free capsule providers, one of them are Flounder\nFlounder gives you own Capsule, where you can put files, posts, and it also provides web proxy, so your friends can enjoy your content from regular web browsers\nThere are, however, some limits:\n\nMax file size: 1MB\nMax user space: 10MB\nMax file count: 1024\n\nThe may seem strict at first, but they are more than enough for Gemini text\nFirst of all you need to register an account, every account is manually approved, so you may need to wait, (in my case I had to wait 2 months, and then I decided to send an email to admin, he immediately approved my registration, huge thanks to him!)\nAfter your registration have been approved, take a look at Tips and tricks and Gemini text guide\nAnd you are ready to start writing!\nWriting Gemtext\nGemtext is a markup language a bit similar to Markdown, it has only most needed formatting\n\nHeaders\nHyperlinks\nLists (such as this one)\nQuotes\nRaw unformatted text\n\nYou can learn Gemtext in 5 minutes, for start, take a look at:\n\nGemtext quick introduction\nGemtext cheatsheet\n\nGemini also supports Unicode, so you can do 🤣️, 🖂, 🗺 and etc.\nIf you are familiar with Markdown, there are Markdown to Gemtext converters, e.g gemgen\n(This post were written in Markdown, so I found out the hard way that gemtext doesn’t support links in text, they need to be on separate line)\nAdding Images\nKnowing about file size and overall available size restrictions of Flounder, you may have question: how I can include images!\nThere are 2 ways, first one is to use put image somewhere at web (Imgur and others) or to put the image directly in your capsule after compression, one of the ways to greatly compress an image is dithering\nDither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images, basically, it allows to reduce the amount of colors in image while keeping somewhat readable image\nFor this you can use Halftone - A simple Linux app that allows you to dither your image in seconds, or you can use Terminal tools such as Pixfect (by me :P), ImageMagick and others. You can also use amazing website for image dithering with some really interesting options - Dither Me This\n\nHalftone\nPixfect\nDither Me This\n\nExample of simple ordered image dithering with 2 colors using ImageMagick 1\n\nI will use Halftone in this example\n\nOpen Halftone and open image\nTweak settings at your liking, I will go with default, except I will change width to 512\nPress “Dither It!”\n\nThis is what we get in the end\n\n\nSan Francisco Bay Bridge photo in dark tones, with Floyd-Steinberg dithering\n\nImage on Unsplash\nNot bad, right? and what’s with the file size? let’s see!\n\nbay-bridge.jpg &gt; 521,9 KB\nhalftone-bay-bridge.png &gt; 26,2 KB\n\nThe decrease is 94.9799%, quite a lot considering limited storage\nNow you can fit 357 photos, while without compression you could only fit 19\nBut, we can go even further, by using less colors and different dithering algorithm\nWith ordered dithering (Bayer) and 2 colors we get the following result\n\n\nSan Francisco Bay Bridge photo in black and white, with Bayer dithering\n\nImage on Unsplash\n\nbay-bridge.jpg &gt; 521,9 KB\nhalftone-bay-bridge-2.png &gt; 4,9 KB\n\n99.0611% decrease\nThe image is notably worse, but it has its own aesthetics, and size speaks for itself\nTaking into account ability to link images from web, images are not such a big issue in Geminispace\nASCII\nASCII art is a good way to give your Gemlog (this is how blogs hosted at Gemini are called) more personality and make them more fun\nASCII art is with us from around 1966, and was invented in large part because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus, characters were used in place of graphic marks that couldn’t display normal images, ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded 2\nASCII art is used to-date, sometimes as a braille art (you likely seen one of these), as image converted to ASCII, as text banners or as emoticons :‑) 3\nImage to ASCII is very common, and you can easily make one yourself!\nGood tools for image to ASCII are:\n\nascii-image-converter - Modern, fast, has some useful options to fine-tune the image\njp2a - Good, time-tested tool\nLetterpress - Based on the jp2a, has good UI made with Libadwaita\n\nascii-image-converter in my experience, works the best\nHere are simple example of ASCII and Braille images made with ascii-image-converter\n\n\nBut, do you think it looks anything like this image?\n\n\nT-6 plane photo in grayscale, with Floyd-Steinberg dithering\n\nImage on Unsplash\nMe neither…\nThe result heavily depends on amount of detail, colors, contrast, the width of ASCII output and etc. you can get pretty decent result, but for images it probably worth just to use dithering ;)\nBut… ASCII works nicely for art and text banners, like this computer!\n\nOr this fancy banner!\n\nThe ASCII art can be found online in huge amounts, I will give you some good websites for start\n\nwww.asciiart.eu - ASCII art archive\nascii.co.uk/art - A LOT of various ASCII art\nasciiart.website - Christopher Johnson’s ASCII art collection\n\nAs for banners, they can be easily created with figlet or toilet, you can easily find installation instructions online, I also recommend to install additional beautiful and sometimes funny fonts from figlet-fonts, which basically consists of few commands\n\n\n\nAnd then you can create your own banner!\n\nTo easily find the perfect font, you can look at font preview\nThere are also amazing graphical app for this - Calligraphy, made specifically for creating ASCII banners!\nYou can also use online tools\nConclusion\nGemini is cozy corner for those who tired of railway noise of the web, it has its own limitations and strengths, and of course, community, in this post we have briefly touched additional topics: dithering and ASCII art\nThere are more things I want to tell you about, I want to write more in-depth post about Dithering, Halftone and tech limitations that forced us to implement such things\nExtra\n\nandregarzia.com/2022/01/gemini-is-a-little-gem.html\nvoidspace.blog/ramble/capsule-importance.gmi\n\n\n\n\nTobias Bernard’s Mastodon post about dithering ↩\n\n\nASCII art at Wikipedia ↩\n\n\nList of emoticons at Wikipedia ↩\n\n\n\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/gemini-exploring-the-cozy-world-of-capsules-and-space/","title":"Gemini: Exploring the Cozy World of Capsules and Space"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/giving-zed-a-shot/":{"body":"Guh? What’s Zed?\nZed is a new and shiny free and open source code editor written in Rust, which automatically means he’s a fast boi. I saw Gabs using it and really liking it, so I thought “after all…why not? why shouldn’t I try it?”\nIn fact, I “tried” it once after Gabs’ first post was published, but I didn’t bother to understand and configure it, so I ended up not using it (classic me huh).\nThis time, however, I decided that it would be fair to actually try it before judging it. I already had it installed, so I went straight to the configuration. Turns out not much needed to be changed, in fact this is my entire settings.json:\n\nYes, I prefer real tabs to spaces. Go cancel me.\nSo why didn’t I use it the first time? I don’t know, maybe the lack of exact extension alternatives to VSCodium put me off.\nSo far I like it, it’s indeed super fast and minimalistic (in a good way).\nI do like VSCodium’s font and rendering a bit more, but that’s probably because I just got used to it. No wonder, I have been using VSCodium continuously for over a year.\n\n\nMy VSCodium setup. Cozy and minimal.\n\nThe built-in formatter is surprisingly good, better than the one in VSCodium; it wraps long CSS properties perfectly, formats automatically on save (VSCodium can do this too, but not as smoothly), and supports modern selectors like .element-1 + .element-2.\nWhat I also like, surprisingly, is the lack of one particular feature: Git integration. In VSCodium it was just annoying and not useful, since it just didn’t work (GPG commit signing, SSH keys, and such) because of Flatpak, and I use lazygit for Git anyway, so I don’t need it at all.\nThere’s even a Monokai Pro theme called Zedokai. It took me a while to find it. It really feels like home, such a great theme.\nI don’t exactly like the AI crap integration, but it’s optional, so I don’t mind.\nWill see how it goes, but so far I like it.\n\n\nMy Zed setup.

Enjoy the roller-coaster!\nThe BigMac Era\nBackstory\nOnce upon a time, there was a chonky 15-inch MacBook Pro, but friends simply called him BigMac. He was manufactured in 2011 and was happy to be a MacBook running macOS, up until one day, when Apple betrayed him and stopped providing him with updates.\nSince then, he was stuck with macOS High Sierra. He thought this was the end, that he would never see the night mode introduced in Mojave, nor the big icon redesign of Big Sur. Hell, he wouldn’t even get any security updates anymore! All he had to do was wait for the unavoidable death.\nBut something outrageous happened one day.\nHe was put on sale.\n“I AM BEING SOLD!?” he exclaimed, but no answer followed, as he’s just a silly BigMac that cannot speak.\nLittle did he know what was about to happen.\nSecond Chance\nTime passed, people asked about him, but in the end, no one bought him. He lost all hope of ever being useful again, until one day, someone called the seller for details. He didn’t hope this would lead to anything, but surprisingly, it did.\nIn a few days, BigMac’s owner arrived at our place. My dad and I asked some things about him, turned him on, and checked some basic things like the system info window, webcam, and charger, but nothing more, since it was our first encounter with such a machine.\nPromptly, we agreed on the price and he was ours. BigMac was shocked by all this; did he just regain his purpose? I showed him off to the rest of the family, played some YouTube videos to see how good the screen and speakers were. I was super happy that day, and so was BigMac.\nPlans Change\nLater that day, I realized the problem with High Sierra: it’s an old version and BigMac doesn’t receive updates anymore. After some quick googling, I found out about something called macOS patchers. An hour later, I had a USB stick with macOS Mojave in hand. I booted BigMac into it, installed Mojave only to discover an issue: his GPU was malfunctioning. A quick lookup revealed it was a common and expensive issue to fix. So the next day, the previous owner and my dad agreed on returning the device without any change in price, and it was returned the same day. Fortunately, all went smoothly.\nBigMac’s history is unknown beyond this point. Hopefully, he became useful to someone in one form or another.\nThe MacBoy Era\nNew Life\nOnce upon a time, there was a small 13-inch MacBook Pro, but friends simply called him MacBoy. The story begins the same way as BigMac’s, but the difference starts at the point of purchase.\nDad and I arrived at MacBoy’s owner’s place, checked the same things as when BigMac was purchased: system info window, webcam, and charger. After agreeing on the price and coming home, flashing a patched Mojave USB and installing it, the journey continued.\n\n\nOne of the photos I took when I tried to sell it at some point XD\n\n\n\nDitto but with the screen on displaying the system info\n\nMacBoy was shocked: “Did I not just become useful again, but also become up-to-date again? My sensors aren’t lying?”\nIt was, in fact, real. I was incredibly happy to have a new friend, and so was MacBoy.\nTime passed, macOS Catalina was released, and it was time for an upgrade. I repeated the same steps as when I installed Mojave. It had some glitches here and there, but otherwise, it was perfectly usable.\nTea Is an Enemy\nOne day, an accident happened: I was working and somehow got into an argument with my little brother, in which he pushed me while I was sipping some sweet tea… MacBoy got soaked. Quickly, I turned it off and sideways for the tea to come out, then put some towels on the keyboard and placed it upside down. When it dried, fortunately, it was working, but the keyboard was, y’know, all sugary and not quite functional.\nAfter trying to clean it without much success, we (my dad and I) went for a replacement. While at the parts shop, we got some upgrades for it: an optibay (a thingy that goes in place of the CD-ROM that allows putting a regular SATA drive in it) and an SSD. At home, I replaced the keyboard, with some struggle but still, upgrades were installed, and it was working like a charm.\nRebirth\nThen Big Sur came out. I, of course, tried to perform the same trick only to find out that it worked horribly slow, had all kinds of graphics glitches, things like iMessage didn’t work at all, and overall, it was a horrible experience.\nAnd so, Catalina it was again. But then I remembered watching some videos about some OS that allowed nice customization, like you could make windows act like jelly and all that. So I found these videos and turned out that OS was Manjaro. Fast forward some time, I flashed a USB stick with Manjaro and installed it on MacBoy.\nMacBoy was shocked, “What the hell is this thing? It doesn’t look anything like my parent company’s OS,” he thought. Moments later, Manjaro was installing, and half an hour later, the installation was complete.\nAfter a quick reboot, MacBoy was shocked to find himself so snappy and fresh, almost like he was a whole new computer. He was used like that for some time until some weird fullscreen glitch appeared and MacBoy was beeping at the same time, so I reinstalled it and looked for a different distro, since this shit scared the living hell out of me.\nI then “distro-hopped”—changed the Linux distribution in search of the right one. Some of them were Ubuntu (the one with the hairy hippopotamus), EndeavourOS, Arch, Cloud Ready (ChromeOS), elementaryOS, Linux Mint, Manjaro, and Fedora. In the process, a lot of data was lost, so from now on I make backups and am very cautious.\nThe choice stopped on Fedora Workstation, as it provided a very clean desktop compared to the over-customized Ubuntu, was fast, and overall very nice, except for one problem (on first-ever install): Wi-Fi was not working. Quickly, MacBoy was connected to the network via Ethernet cable, and the long googling began.\nThe solution was eventually found; it needed a broadcom-wl driver, which required enabling the “RPM Fusion” repository for installation, which didn’t make any sense to me at the time. After unsuccessful attempts to enable it, I found one reply in Fedora forums mentioning some script to enable RPM Fusion and install broadcom-wl. It seemed like a solution, and it even worked somehow.\nEverything was good now; MacBoy and I were happy to be together again, without the bad influence of his parent company. Time passed, new Fedora versions came out, I distro-hopped more, but every time returned to Fedora, migrated from Workstation to Silverblue, learned more about FOSS, and even started contributing translations and later on, even icons. But everything good comes to an end.\n\n\nOne of my Ubuntu installs, not the first one though\n\n\n\nFor some reason I decided to try ChromeOS, yes it was pure dogshit, even the Linux container didn't work\n\n\n\nFor some time I daily-drove EndeavourOS, such a good distro but not exactly for me\n\n\n\nTrying out Sway since everyone kept talking about tiling managers, I wasn't impressed and moved back to GNOME\n\n\n\nMy first \"rice\" that I shared at r/unixporn\n\nThe Repair Hell\nThe charger started acting up: heating, sparking, and not charging. No wonder, it was in an awful state, tape made the rubber decompose entirely. It was clear that it was time for it to be replaced, but the financial situation didn’t quite allow it, so what was left to do was to improvise. First, I knocked the charger a bit to make the pins come out, then sandpapered some metal from the MagSafe connector for the pins to be closer to the MagSafe connector. The issue, by the way, was in the connector pins; they were stuck inside since the spring forcing them outside became very loose or even broke.\nChargerCloseupConnector\n\n\n\n\nThe last charger \"repair\", all serious this time, we even got this thermal thingy!\n\nI used it in this hacky way for a while. It was an unpleasant experience, but there’s so much you can do in such a situation: constantly reconnecting the charger, pulling out the pins, sandpapering more and more metal from the connector. Then the unavoidable happened, it finally died.\n\n\nThe start of my webdev learning, well, one of the unsuccessful attempts\n\nMacBoy was put in a drawer until better times when a new charger could be bought. In the meantime, I used my mom’s laptop to not lose access to a computer entirely.\nWhen the time came, a new charger was bought, and MacBoy was finally working again, but not for long. Very soon, he stopped charging. Since the charger was new, the suspicion fell on the battery, so I used it by powering it on without the battery by disconnecting the charger, holding the power button for 5 seconds, and, while holding it, connecting the charger and then releasing the power button after 5 seconds. Half a year later, a new charger was purchased. All this time, I used my mom’s laptop.\nThe charger worked a single day and then stopped charging. After a month or so, some budget to go to the repair shop was available and we went there, showed the problem and—WAIT IT WORKS, WTF!? Yep, it does; “I will shove the old battery up Satan’s ass,” I thought. To not lose time on nothing, we replaced the noisy fan that became noisy in the period of waiting for a new charger, the broken HDD cable that unexpectedly died one day, and repasted the CPU. Then we went back home.\nSince I used my mom’s laptop for a while, I decided to reinstall Silverblue on MacBoy for it to be clean, then I moved the data back, and started using it.\nONLY FOR IT TO STOP CHARGING, AGAIN!!!\nTo say that I was sad is like saying nothing. I was absolutely crushed knowing that we’re not in the best financial situation and that fucker kept sucking the family’s money and my soul.\nAnyhow, we went to the repair shop once again (of course after a while), and this time requested them to actually perform the full diagnosis to know why it doesn’t fucking charge.\nTen days passed, no call from the repair shop, so Dad called first. The answer followed:\n\nUh yeah, so I don’t really know where exactly the issue is, but I suspect that it’s the power controller. I can replace it, but it’s dangerous and there will be a 30% chance that the motherboard will burn afterward. So yeah, it’s up to you to decide.\n\nThe next day (or the next-next day, I don’t remember), we went there to take it since that’s not an answer one wants to hear. Like, what the hell does it mean there’s a 30% chance of failure?\nThe repairman wasn’t even at the shop when we arrived, so his coworker assembled MacBoy (yes, it was freaking disassembled) and gave it to us, asking if we would like him to see MacBoy instead but it would require 2-3 more days. Of course, we declined this offer; they had 10 days and still didn’t even assemble it, and it was super dirty on top of that, really showing the level of “care” they put into the repair.\nWhile still there (on a street filled to the brim with repair shops), we started searching for a different Mac repair shop. A lot of stores pointed to a shop of one talented man that does Mac repairs; “best in town.” We went there, described our issue, and he immediately tried to fix it by resoldering the power controller (the one that the previous repair shop said would have a failure chance if resoldered), but unfortunately, it didn’t help. So he asked us to leave it for a few days since a more in-depth diagnosis needs time.\nTwo weeks later, no call from the repair shop, so Dad once again called first. The answer:\n\nSo yeah, I tried everything, but no luck. Sorry man. I’m quite certain that the motherboard is dead.\n\nSooo we went and took it back. Since it was clear that trying further was pointless, we decided to return some of the parts from earlier visits; after all, they were only used for a few days at best. A lot of arguing later, we agreed on returning the charger, HDD cable, fan, and battery for half the price we bought them for, so we got back ~$110 in total. It was a good deal and a good start for saving up for a new laptop.\nWhile still there, we checked all the nearby stores if they would like to buy it for parts. No one did, unfortunately (or fortunately).\nConclusion\nIt was a long and interesting journey, but everything comes to an end. MacBoy was put in a drawer until better times when we can get another same MacBook and take the motherboard from it and put it in MacBoy, resulting in a FrankenBook. Until then, the story ends here.\n\n\nCurrent state, it turns on for a few minutes using the direct power method and old charger, but that's about it\n\nLaughs GOTCHA! It doesn’t. We already got the new laptop, more on that in the next post. Stay tuned!\n\n\nThis post's draft open on said new laptop, Dell Latitude E7470\n\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/macboy-chronicles/","title":"MacBoy Chronicles: The Complete Edition"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/migration-from-github-to-codeberg/":{"body":"Backstory\nOn January 8, 2021, I have joined GitHub, back then I knew very little about FOSS and how it works, haven’t done design ever and had awful knowledge of English, to point that I used Google Translate to understand the text.\nThings have changed since then, but this post is not about this (or is it).\nGitHub is the biggest Git service that every developer knows about, a lot of open source projects use it because it provides free Git hosting and very convenient tools such as Actions and Pages, but not everything is perfect, and where there’s Microsoft there’s bad stuff.\nIt is owned by Microsoft for a long time, which is the first red sign. When Russo-Ukrainian War began, GitHub started suspending accounts and deleting repositories of Russian developers who has nothing to do with war but the fact that they were in Russia (info varies). Last year they launched Copilot - an AI code completion and suggestion software trained on FOSS projects, violating the GPL license. Microsoft itself has not the cleanest history with FOSS and Linux, but listing every incident here would take a lot of time.\nRecently I were contributing to some projects hosted on Codeberg, and I had to create an account and use it for some time, and… I liked it! The UI of Codeberg; the workflow and the overall vibe were really nice, the fact that Codeberg is very open with its Community helped a lot too.\n\n\tApparently I have contributed to one project earlier, so I already had a Codeberg account xD\n\n\n\nCodeberg is non-profit powered by Forgejo - a soft-fork of Gitea.\n\n(…) We started Forgejo in reaction to control of Gitea being taken away from the community by the newly-formed for-profit company Gitea Ltd without prior community consultation, and after an Open Letter to the Gitea project owners remained unanswered.\n\n\nAnd I started thinking of and preparing for migration.\nWhy not GitLab?\nGood question, I honestly don’t know. As a matter of fact, GitLab is a bit confusing for me (especially after recent sidebar redesign) and I just liked Codeberg so much, it’s small and cute :)\nMigration\n\nI have found about that Dan Erat have published an article about his migration from GitHub to Codeberg before this one, check it out.\n\nAfter final decision that I will migrate my personal repositories to Codeberg I have created a poll on Mastodon, in which asked what to do with repositories on GitHub, people decided that adding small note in README that tells about migration and gives a link to repository on Codeberg, and then archiving were the best approach, and so I did it!\nRepositories\nThe migration of repositories were very simple - I have created GitHub Fine-grained personal access token which I used to give Codeberg access to GitHub repositories\nYou can fine-tune the migration - enable migration of pull requests, issues, labels, releases, milestones and wiki, all by simply checking a box.\nRedirect\nTo make the migration as smooth as possible for everyone, I have added redirect from GitHub pages to Codeberg pages right before archiving, so all the links will continue work just like before.\nTo do so, I have added this two lines to &lt;head&gt; of HTML\n\nGitHub Pages → Codeberg Pages\nSpeaking of Codeberg pages, I have successfully recreated the workflow of GitHub pages with said Codeberg pages and Woodpecker - CI service that Codeberg provides (you need to request access), which allows running various jobs on changes. Тhe one I needed were Jekyll - Static site generator from Markdown (and not only) that are used by GitHub pages and this blog is powered by.\nWoodpecker\n\nSee blog post by Jan Wildeboer for better understanding how the CI works, since this guy created the workflow used here.\n\nFirst, I have requested and waited for manual approval to access to Woodpecker CI by opening an issue here and selecting Woodpecker CI Access, it took a few hours, so when I woke up I already had access.\nAfter approval, I have created blog-source and blog repositories (names can be whatever you want), the later will contain the generated static site, and should only have pages branch in it, and created .woodpecker.yml file in the blog-source repository.\nThen copy and paste the contents of Jekyll workflow example in .woodpecker.yml\n\nAfter that, open it in your favorite text editor and replace:\n\nCBIN with source repository (blog-source)\nCBOUT with output repository (blog)\nCBUSER with your Codeberg username\n\nPersonally I use VSCodium, fork of VSCode with Microsoft telemetry removed.\nPush all the changes and Generate an Access Token, you need to generate token named cbtoken with the repo scope selected\n\nThen copy the resulted token and save it to a safe place, as it won’t be shown again.\nGo to Woodpecker and navigate to Repositories tab and add a new repository (blog-source)\n\nNavigate to Settings and go to Secrets tab\n\n\nHere create two secrets, cbmail and cbtoken\ncbmail should contain your Codeberg account email\n\nAnd cbtoken should contain the secret we saved earlier\n\nMake sure these two secrets have successfully created and make some changes in blog-source to trigger the CI, it should finish successfully.\n\nIf you don’t want to trigger the CI (the change doesn’t affect content for example) you can add [CI SKIP] to your commit message to skip the CI.\n\n\nNow it’s up to you to choose Jekyll theme and write something ;)\nIn my case I already had blog based on jimmac/os-component-website (this blog) so it were all I needed to do.\nConclusion\nThe migration from GitHub to Codeberg were simple and smooth, but not without issues, I had difficulties understanding how to make Woodpecker secrets work and how to create them in first place, this is why I wrote this post in first place.\n\n\tIn Gitea and consequently in Forgejo v1.20 the secret creation UI have been completely changed, and it’s more clear than current one\n\n\nGuys over Codeberg seem to be very nice so if you value your code then you may want to do the same :)\nThis is all for now, take cake care!\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/migration-from-github-to-codeberg/","title":"Migration from GitHub to Codeberg"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/my-first-domain/":{"body":"\nI know I said in the previous post that the next post would be about how my Pixel 3 committed suicide, but I didn’t quite feel like publishing 3 posts in a row about my devices dying and being replaced, plus I haven’t researched the topic enough and don’t have much to tell about the replacement, so it will stay in the drafts folder for a bit longer.\nI do have another post in the works and expect it to be quite interesting, so yeah!\n\nToday—I mean, the 22nd of June—I fulfilled my little dream: I got my very own domain!\nYes, you read that right.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me; I just wanted it so badly.\nAt first (back in the “Space” theme era), I thought I’d get daudix.space, but later on changed my mind since I’m not really into astronomy, it felt a bit lengthy and I didn’t plan on hosting public services, which are usually associated with this TLD. I considered other options, but they were expensive. Then I remembered about zagura.one and seirdy.one, what was common about them is this nice TLD: one.\nIt was perfect: one of the cheapest options, one of a kind, and not a boring one.\n\n\tOnly after getting the domain, I realized it’s actually a huge one reference. So yes, the pun was not in fact intended.\n\n\nA while later, I finally decided it was time, even if I might not be able to pay for the next year.\nAnd so, in the early morning of June 22nd, I started the research with serious intentions. First, I checked Porkbun since I heard good things about it and exozyme (the coziest community) uses it as far as I know. Surprisingly, daudix.one was super cheap—just $1.57 (renewal will cost $13.88, which is still cheaper than many other options).\nFor fun, I also checked daudix.io, which cost a whopping $40! Then I checked Cloudflare Registrar since apparently they charge only the required fees without any markup, but it didn’t have .one TLD, so I checked Namecheap, where daudix.one cost $2.60 or something like that. So I settled on Porkbun.\nOne registration and payment later, I got that email from Porkbun!\n\n\nThe long-awaited Porkbun invoice stating that I have just successfully purchased a daudix.one domain\n\n“Hooray!” - thought I. Promptly I tried connecting it to Codeberg Pages, but it didn’t go well, so I went to sleep.\nIn the evening of the same day, I tried to finish the setup, but after countless attempts, I gave up and had to refund it :&lt;\nJust kidding, Porkbun doesn’t accept refunds.\nI asked for help in Codeberg’s Matrix room and promptly got some suggestions. They didn’t work on their own, but putting my issue into words helped me realize something: I used an obscure method of deploying Codeberg pages by pushing static files to the pages branch of the pages repo, while the main branch is supposed to be used for static files. This confused the Pages server, causing it to spit out some unhelpful error messages. After renaming the repository to website and re-adding some scary IP addresses and TXTs into Porkbun one more time… it still didn’t work.\nI was super tired and had no will to mess with this that day, so I kinda forgot about it and gone to do some other stuff.\nOnly to return and find it working!\nYes, apparently it needed a bit more time than 15 minutes to fully propagate. In the end, everything was working, so I repeated the steps to make Duckquill use its own subdomain. It was a bit of a pain (mostly me making silly typos), but I got it working eventually.\n\n\nThe final DNS setup for this site and Duckquill\n\nThe next day, I created the pages repository and added a _redirects file to make the old daudix.codeberg.page address redirect to the new one, while keeping the path (so e.g. daudix.codeberg.page/ananas-duck becomes daudix.one/ananas-duck and not just daudix.one).\n\nYup, that’s the entire file! It doesn’t work perfectly though; links have a double slash after the domain (daudix.one//blog/), but it doesn’t seem to affect page loading, so it’s fine, I guess?\n\n\tAwesome Anthony suggested me to try removing the slash between the domain and :splat (so it becomes https://daudix.one:splat), and it worked!\n\n\n\n\tChanged HTTP response from 302 “Moved Temporarily” to 301 “Moved Permanently”. The final _redirects is:\n\n\n\nAnd that’s about it! I’m super happy to be a real internet citizen and, in the long run, to be able to move the site between different hosting services without constantly changing links everywhere.\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/my-first-domain/","title":"One Little Domain or How I Got My First Domain"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/new-strategy/":{"body":"I can’t write.\nI have to write.\nI suck at writing.\nI want to, but can’t.\nWhat should I write about.\nThese are my constant thoughts since I started this goddamn challenge, and it’s been sucking my energy quite a bit.

I teased that I would tell more about it in the next post, and well, this is that post :)\nClears throat alright, where did we stop last time… paper noises, aha!\nAfter returning the unneeded parts, we got back $110, which was a good starting point for saving up for the next laptop. Why a laptop and not a PC? As silly as it sounds, I simply cannot sit in the same spot for longer than 10 minutes, especially if that spot is a desk, so a laptop is a requirement, not a choice.\nSome boring money saving later, we (me, Mom, and later on Dad) started the search. Initially, we searched for ThinkPads since ThinkPad cult members people say they are very durable, upgradable, have good Linux support, and overall they are the best thing in the world (to be fair they do look badass).\nA few listings and some Notebookcheck review reading later, it became clear that virtually all ThinkPads in the desired price category (~$210) suffer from the same issue: sRGB coverage around 56%. This isn’t a big deal if the only thing you do is write reports in Microsoft Word and scroll through Facebook memes, but it’s crucial if you do even basic design work.\nSo we decided to look at Dell; my Mom had a Dell laptop before and it was a good machine. After scrolling through all listings from our city and checking every single one of them on Notebookcheck for the sRGB coverage, it became clear that the situation was somewhat similar to ThinkPads, but there was one listing that was interesting… (I’ve skipped the boring false positives).\nDell Latitude E7470 - 2017 ultrabook in great condition, with decent specs, and, most importantly, 96% sRGB coverage (at least so I thought)! MacBoy had full sRGB coverage, but still, it was very close, and comparing it to other laptops with 56% coverage it was the best variant. The price was sane as well: $230.\n\n\nFeels good to hold a laptop that is twice as thin and light as MacBoy\n\n\n\nEven though its screen is 14 inches it's just as compact as MacBoy; thin bezels compensate the screen size\n\nIt’s Time\nThe next day - 5th of June - while I was asleep, Mom told Dad about this variant, and he promptly called the seller to not miss such an opportunity. He asked if the machine in the listing was the same one, and it was indeed the same machine and all was OK, so he agreed on the purchase and delivery (which was free) the same day.\nI woke up only to hear the surprising like snow-in-the-summer news, and I was happy and nervous at the same time—hapvous.\nA few hours of painful sociophobic waiting later, the seller finally called me (since Dad already went to work) that he was on the way and would arrive within an hour. An hour later he called me again to say he had arrived at our place. I went out, took a deep breath, took the briefcase with the laptop from the seller’s car trunk, opened it, took out the laptop, opened it, gave it a quick glance just to make sure it wasn’t an empty chassis or in an unacceptable state (I was super nervous so I didn’t even check if the model was the right one), said “y-yeah all good, hopefully”, gave the money and rushed headed home at a steady pace.\nBeing excited, I turned the laptop on, disgusted by Windows and its awful design, scrolling, ads in the start menu—distant cough oh yeah, I got a little carried away. I went to YouTube and searched for “Costa Rica HDR” and turned that one video on, doing the same on Mom’s Sony Vaio that I used for the last year. And something unexpected happened.\nA Fly in the Ointment\nYou ready? sighs The screen turned out to be dogshit. Yes, the very reason why I dismissed all the nice ThinkPads and Dells. I mean, I’m grateful and all, but it’s not even close to 96% sRGB; heck, it’s even slightly less saturated than the bootleg replacement screen on said Sony Vaio!\nI was disappointed and saddened, another “yes, but-” moment, all the searching was pointless as I could’ve got the first powerful ThinkPad for the same price, since the screen is the same level shit anyways, but it was late for the smart thoughts, so I just went along with it.\nThe crucial detail that I didn’t give enough attention to is the fact that the Latitude in Notebookcheck was the high-end configuration; with the 4K touch screen, fingerprint scanner, and Intel Core i7 instead of i5 like in my unit. For some reason, I thought that the only difference between the touch 4K version and the FHD matte screen version was the resolution and the absence of, you know, the touch, but no, only the touch screen version has good color accuracy. The ones with matte screens (1920x1080 and 1366x768) have a generic sRGB coverage for this type of laptop - 50-something percent (for some reason there’s virtually no reviews for these versions, so no exact numbers). My ignorance has played a bad trick against me once again.\nThen I discovered that closing the lid doesn’t put it in sleep mode. I thought it was a Windows issue, so I didn’t give it much attention.\nThe Good\nBad things aside, I flashed a new Fedora Silverblue USB and installed it, which was an absolute breeze; no need to install broadcom-wl to get the WiFi working, no need for RPM Fusion for broadcom-wl and all the trickery needed to enable it on Silverblue, no need to add acpi_backlight=auto kernel argument to make the minimal screen brightness not burn your eyes, everything “just worked” out of the box. I knew Dell shipped some laptops with Linux and they’re (way) more Linux-friendly than Apple, but damn, I didn’t expect it to be this good.\n\n\nHow can one talk about a new laptop with Linux installed and not show a neofetch neowofetch screenshot!?\n\nAfter the installation, I opened Software to update the system, and… BIOS AND FIRMWARE UPDATES!? Fwupd is good huh.\nThen I opened Settings to check the Device Security tab, just for fun and giggles, and IT’S ALL GREEN!? On MacBoy it was all red, since no secure boot and such.\n\nThen I decided to watch some videos, connected the headphones and A HEADPHONE TYPE SELECTOR POPPED OUT!? MacBoy didn’t have this as well, it was a headset all the time. Here, on the other hand, I can connect it as headphones, a headset, or just a microphone.\n\nI used it for hours moving data from Vaio and MacBoy, and the battery didn’t drain. I can do 3 hours of work and watch some YouTube videos and it will still have 20% left. I still can’t get used to it after two weeks, it feels so good after the absence of battery and constant issues with the charger.\nThe keyboard has a longer travel distance than MacBoy and doesn’t have the slight key drift that makes keys make an annoying sound. It feels so good to write blog posts on it. The touchpad is decent as well, not the same glass trackpad though, it has a bit harsh scrolling (in the sense that it doesn’t scroll pixel by pixel but rather 2-3 pixels at a time) and it doesn’t click, meaning I need to either tap to click or use the dedicated buttons, which are present on both top and bottom of the touchpad at least. It still annoys me a little even 2 weeks later.\nOne brand new thing for me was the trackpoint. This thing was so weird and confusing at first, but I slowly started to get it. It’s super useful in Blender and, to my surprise, Portal 2 :3\nAll these little things made my mood better and I no longer regretted the purchase. Sure, the screen wasn’t the one I wanted, sleep on closed lid doesn’t work since apparently the bezel was replaced and the magnet in it is absent and there’s no “Dell” typed on it, soft touch plastic collects all the dust and fingerprints by just looking at it and is constantly sticky no matter what you do, but it’s not critical.\nConclusion\nOverall, I love this laptop. MacBoy was a good machine, but this one is a whole new level.\nP.S. While making the final edits to this post I’ve come up with a name for Latitude - Latte!\nP.P.S.

(well, I just don’t know what to blog about xD)\nTeardown is a game released back in 2022, but I have played the early access version released in 2020 on YouTube (as in, I watched let’s plays). Recently I decided to replay it, and it’s been pretty fun, the process of carefully coming up with an optimal route and then executing it in under 60 seconds is pretty entertaining. My little brother seems to enjoy watching all this happen as well.\nIn terms of visuals, it’s pretty fresh, using voxel graphics à la MagicaVoxel along with semi-realistic physics that work very well together. It’s fun to just walk around and smash stuff with a sledge, toss chairs around, break glass, demolish buildings using propane tanks, and such.\nDue to hardware limitations I had to change the rendering quality all the way down to 50%, but even then it looks awesome, here’s some shots from built-in photo mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sound design in this game is top notch, from the braking sounds of the various cars to the soundtrack, let alone the track that plays during the escape.\nThe story side of the game is pretty fun as well. We are playing as an “owner of a financially stricken demolition company, who is caught undertaking a questionable job and becomes entangled between helping police investigations and taking on further dubious assignments” (thanks Wikipedia). What I find funny is how rich guys contact the player and ask to steal some other rich guy’s cars or whatever, only for that rich guy to contact us and say that “someone” stole his cars and ask us to take revenge by stealing his paintings or whatever. Working for both sides at its best :P\nI’m currently on the level “Crook,” which is quite early on, and I think it’s going to take a while to complete it at the current rate; 1 mission per gaming session, which takes 40 mins - 1 hour.\nAnother funny thing is that Steam thinks it’s purchased, even though I just added the legally acquired version to the library. It seems that the cloud saves work even.\n\nAs this is a Windows-only game, I play it through Proton and it… just works? I simply added it to my games library and ticked the “Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool” checkbox in its settings, nothing more. In fact, I moved all my games to the Steam library to play them through Proton, as it works without the sheganings Bottles has (Bottles is still a very cool app).\nAnd that’s about it.

I have it for as long as this blog, but all this time I wasn’t sure how to use it. I could keep a gemtext version of all my posts there, but that’s a lot of work, and it’s not really worth it, as you can browse my website using w3m perfectly well.\nIt’s simply been collecting dust. It had some out-of-date gemtext versions of blog posts, but that’s pretty much it.\nWhen I got my domain I remembered about it and decided to try resurrecting it.\nOn the 10th of July, I finally sat down, setup custom domain for it (gmi.daudix.one, how original…) converted all posts to gemtext using gemgen by manually cd’ing in every post folder, running gemgen index.md, renaming the file to &lt;directory name&gt;.gmi, Alt + ← to go back to previous directory, and repeating this for all posts.\nAfter 2 hours of fixing broken links, images, videos, tables and weird text after stripping away all the sweet formatting, I was left with a very bland version of a rich text blog…\nI’ve been thinking that day. What should I do with it?\nShould I delete my flounder account?\nShould I move to a different hosting?\nShould I simply keep it as is and write about something more interesting than tinkering with a dead capsule made with an obscure piece of tech?\nI wasn’t sure, so I kept this spinning in my head for a few days.\nToday I have finally decided: I’ll keep the capsule, but will get rid of all the gemtext versions of this blog’s posts (that took me 2 hours to convert), and will use it to jot down some notes and quick thoughts that don’t fit here, and, most importantly, it’s easier to edit a file through flounder’s web interface than to:\n\nOpen file manager.\nNavigate to the website source folder.\nCreate a new post folder with a date -I timestamp.\nInside it, create an index.md file.\nFill in the front matter.\nType the actual note.\nOpen terminal.\ngit add said note, commit, and push.\nWait for the CI to complete.\n\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/repurposing-gemini-capsule/","title":"Repurposing My Gemini Capsule"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/rewriting-neocities-website/":{"body":"\nThis is my first #100DaysToOffload post; what this means is that I’ll post more and about more diverse stuff.

A dedicated post about this will be published soon (hopefully nervous giggling).\n\n\n\tIt’s been published (4 days later and not in half a year!).\n\n\n\n\tThis post has been featured in exozyine!\n\n\nAs you might know, almost a year ago I got a website on Neocities: the modern-age Geocities with not so modern personal websites. I always liked the idea of having website there, but never actually got my hands on it… until now, woo-hoo!\nOn the 31st of May I started rewriting it. 4 days later, it seems to be better than what it was in every aspect, so I decided to write this post sharing some insights on how it was done ^_^\n\n\nThe pre-rewrite state; boring and sad\n\nAll started by copy-pasting sadgrl’s Simple Skinny 00s layout, since I suck at this. The layout seemed perfect so I started tweaking it. After stealing the button shading styles from DeviantArt and getting this nice background from the same sadgrl’s website, I had this:\n\n\nFirst steps; empty and sad\n\nFast-forward a few hours, I had some very basic thingy going!\nThe icons are from Tango, an icon theme that had it’s last release 15 years ago, back in 2009. Project’s website is down, but download link still works somehow: http://tango.freedesktop.org/releases/tango-icon-theme-0.8.90.tar.bz2\n\n\nFirst demo; navbar got icons and footer was added\n\nSee that footer? yes, it uses a deprecated marquee HTML element, it’s just too good to not be used. I even posted about it on Mastodon.\n\n\nAt this point it was 4:00 AM and I had to go sleep 0_0\n\n\nGroup chat forces me to go sleep\n\nYeah, I enjoyed the rewrite a bit too much.\nAaanyway, the next day I added the cbox chat, polished the footer, and teased it to my Mastodon followers.\n\n\nAbout chat box: cbox doesn’t allow adding custom CSS in the free plan, so I couldn’t add the text shadow for the carved text effect, what I did is applied a drop-shadow() filter to the whole &lt;iframe&gt; which did the job.\nThen I added a fake music player to the top-right corner (which was an absolute pain to create, I could’ve used CSS grid to avoid all the alignment issues, but it’s just confusing so I settled on this hacky unresponsive mess), further polished the design, fixed the mobile version, removed the ability to move and resize the chat box (it was buggy and quite useless), and drawn a favicon and a bookmark inspired by one on the old DeviantArt. In fact, a lot of things were inspired by DeviantArt of 2010’s\n\n\nFake music player with some brony music\n\nMobileTablet\n\n\n\n\tThe music player initially displayed PrinceWhateverer’s Miscommunication as it’s very relatable, but since I aimed for the 2010’s vibe, I decided to change it to WoodenToaster’s Rainbow Factory since it was released in 2011 and were quite popular back then.\n\n\nDeviantArtMine\n\n\n\n\tInitially the bookmark said “Work In Process”, but I realised that it won’t exit this state anytime soon, so it were changed to “Forever WIP”\n\n\nAnd that’s about it! there’s one issue that bothers me, the footer; it’s absolute positioned relatively to the “paper” and it overlays on top of the scrollbar, which is meh.\n\n\nFooter's opacity is changed for demo purposes\n\nOne more thing I want to mention is Neocities CLI. If you have ever used Neocities you know the pain of upload files to it via the web interface, it does provide WebDAV mount for supporters, BUT there’s another way, the official CLI tool!\nIt allows pushing local files or whole directories directly to your Neocities website, it’s distributed as a Ruby gem but it works just fine.\nSeriously, this thing saved my nerves.\n\n\nHelp page; love the humor\n\n\n\nPusing local directory to Neocities with deletion of files not present locally\n\nThanks for reading!

It’s been published back in 2011 and it’s still the best article out of ones that I read when researching this topic.\n\nBefore we get to modern times and neo-Luddism–the philosophy that opposes many forms of modern technology–we need to understand what the original Luddism was. And no, it’s not what you think it is today.\nLuddism was a movement of English textile workers who opposed the use of certain types of automated machinery–lace frames that allowed one worker to do the work of many without the necessary skills–because of concerns about lower wages and a lower quality of output; the market was flooded with cheaper, inferior goods such as “cut-ups,” stockings made from two pieces of fabric joined together rather than knit as one continuous piece.\nIt began in England in the early 1800s, during a period of increasing industrialization, hard economic times due to costly conflicts with Napoleon’s France and the United States, and widespread unrest among workers. Food was scarce and rapidly becoming more expensive, poverty entered homes where it was unfamiliar, and unemployment was a real problem.\nThe government repeatedly failed to intervene on behalf of the workers, and what was left was to attack the factories.\nOn March 11, 1811, in Nottingham–a textile manufacturing center–British troops broke up a crowd of protesters demanding more work and better wages.\nThat night, angry workers smashed textile machinery in a nearby village. Similar attacks occurred at first at night, then sporadically, then in waves, eventually spreading across a 70-mile swath of northern England from Loughborough in the south to Wakefield in the north.\nThey often smashed machines in textile factories in organized raids. “Nine hundred lace frames were smashed,” the newspaper reported. They took their name from the story of Ned Ludd, a mythical weaver who supposedly smashed two knitting machines with a hammer in a fit of rage. They used it as a pseudonym in threatening letters to factory owners and government officials, these letters explained their reasons for destroying the machinery and threatened further action if the use of “obnoxious” machines continued.\nIt’s important to note that the Luddites didn’t just smash any machines; they only targeted machines owned by manufacturers who were known to pay low wages, disregard workers’ safety, and/or speed up the pace of work.\nEven within a single factory that contained machines owned by different capitalists, some machines were destroyed and others weren’t, depending on the business practices of their manufacturers.\nThe Luddites didn’t oppose the new technology per se, but rather the misuse of it; many of them were highly skilled machine operators in the textile industry, and the idea of smashing machines as a form of industrial protest did not begin or end with them.\nThe technology they were attacking wasn’t all that new either; Luddites often attacked stocking frames, knitting machines that had been developed more than 200 years earlier. What was new was the steady replacement of workers with it.\nThe terror of violence caused some factory owners to abandon their plans for automation. They reverted to manual labor or closed up shop altogether. For a time, it seemed that the Luddites were making progress in winning over machines.\nBut in the end, the factory owners won: they convinced the state to make “frame breaking” a treasonable crime, punishable by execution and penal transportation.\nThe Luddites existed for 5 years until they were suppressed by legal and military forces; government ultimately dispatched 12,000 troops to suppress Luddite activity. Dozens of workers were executed for Luddite activities, including a whopping fourteen on one brutal day in January 1813. George Mellor, the Luddite captain, was eventually convicted of murdering Horsfall, the mill owner, and hanged at the age of twenty-three.\nBut the idea continued to live on…\nBanner sources:\n\nThe map: Wikimedia\nThe Leader of the Luddites: Wikimedia\nThe Luddites hammering: Tom Morgan, Mary Evans Picture Library\n\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/story-of-luddism/","title":"How People Got Fed Up: Luddism"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/syncthing-in-toolbx/":{"body":"Today I wanted to reduce the amount of layered packages on my Silveblue install, sure thing it was easy to do, but there was one thing that wasn’t this easy, Syncthing.\nThe issue is that it needs to autostart on login, otherwise it’s useless.

There’s nothing urgent going on there, so I’m just not going to check them. I honestly have no idea why I’m feeling this way, I can’t think of any reasonable reason, and that makes me even sadder; there are people who have actual reasons to feel bad, but they don’t, and then there’s me, feeling like shit for no fucking reason.\nAnyhoo, see you in the next one!\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/taking-a-break/","title":"Taking a Short Break"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/using-dumbphone/":{"body":"Backstory\nSomewhere in the middle of 2021, I got my favorite phone yet: Pixel 3 (white, with a teal power button, 64GB model).\nLet’s rewind a bit earlier. Rewind sounds intensifies.\n\nA while back, I’ve used an iPhone 7 (gold, 128GB). It was a great device, and later on, it was fun to jailbreak, all until one day when Apple put an end to jailbreak with the release of iOS 15 (potential post?).\nSince then, I’ve been thinking about a replacement. Around the same time, I started to care about privacy and FOSS alternatives to popular apps, so I looked for something that allowed installing custom ROMs (and had a great camera, of course). I knew exactly what this device was–Pixel 3.\nWhen the time came, we got it without a doubt, and it was an amazing device; the camera was as great as advertised, the OLED screen after IPS was something revolutionary, and battery life, oh boy, it was times better than the non-existent longevity of the iPhone. I had used Android phones before, so openness wasn’t something new for me.\n\n\n\tWe got it by exchanging it for an iPhone SE (the one that looks like iPhone 5) with some extra cash, since its owner wanted to switch to iOS–the opposite of what we wanted to do XD\n\n\n\nAfter enjoying the stock ROM for 2 weeks/month, I decided to finally give custom ROMs a shot. My first one was LineageOS, and it’s still my favorite; no bloat, the latest Android, plus some useful perks.\nOf course, I’ve tried out the famous GrapheneOS, but I wasn’t impressed by it; it was just as out-of-date as the stock ROM and the launcher was kinda meh.\nI’ve tried other ROMs as well, such as CalyxOS, PixelBuilds, and a bunch of others, names of which I forgor 💀. Most of them were either bloated or low-effort remixes of LineageOS, so I just ended up using the original.\nCustom ROMs without Google services are quite sad though; no notifications in most apps, some apps won’t launch at all, so I’ve used a combination of Magisk and this microG module. This setup was the most optimal one, i.e. LineageOS for microG is out-of-date and offers the same functionality as said Magisk module. I also didn’t use a custom recovery such as TWRP, since it was pretty useless for me (you can re-root after an OTA update right from Magisk), plus, it didn’t survive OTA updates ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nOne day (Dec 21, 2022, around 4am) something silly happened to it. I was doing my bed before going to sleep, and I didn’t notice that it was sitting on the blanket, and, well, I shook out the blanket and it flew with the speed of light right onto the metal chair leg, and of course, that day I didn’t put the cover on. Frankly it all came down to a broken back glass. Imagine if it had fallen on the screen…\nOtherwise, everything was almost perfect. I found the perfect setup and simply enjoyed my phone; took photos, mindlessly scrolled through social media, chatted the same way I could on a laptop, this kind of stuff.\nThen, on the evening of the 16th of April…\nWhy the intrigue, you know exactly what will happen next, since you saw the title and maybe read previous posts :^)\nHere We Go Again\nIt suddenly stopped turning on. Yup, one more dead device.\nNo, life, this joke doesn’t get funnier with repetition! :/\nIt was sitting on my desk. I checked the mail and chats as usual, sent a few messages, and put it back. 10 minutes later I came back, only to find it having no signs of life.\nTotal absence; no vibration, no sound, nothing on the screen, even nothing when connecting to a PC.\nTurns out, I’m not the first, and not even the second person to have this exact issue. A lot of others have reported the same scenario and no one managed to get it to boot again. Some took it to repair shops, where they were told to replace the screen, but since the issue was not the screen but rather a hardware bug in the CPU (!!!) that causes the device to stuck in EDL mode, it didn’t help. Instead, Google sent them new devices.\nGiven how popular this problem is, Google should’ve shared the signed firehose programmer so people could at least try to do something about it, but 4 years later they still haven’t.\nAlright, I lied that no one managed to boot it again. One or two managed to boot it after leaving it for a year in a drawer without charging, but that’s it.\nAfter trying everything possible and impossible to turn it back on (letting it discharge for a few weeks, beating it, pressing all the buttons for different durations and combinations, did I mention Russian beating?) I gave up and accepted the fact that I will never get out all my photos, Signal chats, and everything else that wasn’t backed up (I didn’t back up for like forever), and put it in the drawer. I still check it regularly, but I don’t have hopes for it.\nDumb Situation\n\nI had nothing to do but to pull out an old dumbphone; Nokia 100 from 2011!\nWhoa, whoa, whoa! what do you mean by a dumbphone? Do you mean simply an old phone or- No, I mean a “Feature phone,” the one even dumber than me.\nIt’s actually “Schrödinger’s old;” it’s been manufactured in 2011, but it’s still perfectly new, it wasn’t really used until I took it.\nI’ve been considering switching to a dumbphone to reduce my screen time before, but it was just considerations. Now, it’s a perfect opportunity for this (not that I have a choice :P).\n\nTo this day, I use it to set my morning alarm—yes, alarm in singular, it can’t set multiple—to check the time, and sometimes to put some thoughts in its reminders app (that only allows super short sentences) to then rewrite them on my laptop. It also has some exclusive game titles, like “Forbidden Treasures”, “Vacation Solitaire”, and the famous “Snake Xenzia” (sounds almost like Xenia XD).\nBattery life doesn’t need any praise; nearly a week on a single charge speaks up for itself.\n\nNow, listen closely r/unixporn enjoyers, this phone has something for you; built-in recoloring system, with some built-in wallpapers! I know, it’s shocking, but it’s real.\n\nAs for the calendar, I switched to a paper one hanging on the wall.\nTurns out it’s a nice feeling to circle out days every morning and be able to highlight some days with the marker. The only issue is that I eventually forget what they supposed to mean giggles.\nI’ve moved to my laptop for all the stuff I did on mobile, and not only is it faster and easier, it’s also less addicting, since it requires more effort to pick up a laptop than to lift up a phone to scroll through social media. And it turns out you don’t need to respond to everything the second it arrives, it can wait until you open your laptop, perhaps even longer.\nI enjoy this journey so far, and have no plans on returning to a smartphone. I’ve been way more productive and, perhaps, slightly happier.\nThe only issue I have is that the dumbphone is, well, old, so it can’t call and send/receive SMS, which is the entire purpose of a phone like this one. That’s because it depends on a recently shutdown 2G, and now 3G is a minimal requirement by carriers. Not that I call a lot–1-2 times a year, even then it’s spam calls–but I still need SMS messages for 2FA.\nConclusion\nMy old phone was awesome, and I enjoyed every day of using it, but I also do enjoy using my new phone, maybe it’s a bit dumb, but it’s cute ^_^\nFree time from lack of phone and 100 Days To Offload is a good combination, although I do feel a bit overwhelmed (alright, not a bit, very much so) by not following the graph well and not having enough good ideas for posts, plus I’m not satisfied by the quality of the posts, I think I can do better.\nP.S.

I lost my mind on the third day without making any progress. I asked some people about using Hugo and their reaction was something like “Oh God, use anything but Hugo, you will regret using it”, and it was true.\nI then tried Zola, which at first seemed like a worse Jekyll with some features missing, but after trying it out it was actually Jekyll 2.0.\nB-but why move from Jekyll in the first place?\nWell… there were a few reasons for this, like speed, Ruby dependency hell, broken internal linking and the need for third-party plugins for basic functionality, but the last straw was…\nJekyll Issues\nOne of the recent issues with Jekyll was that Dart Sass support didn’t work due to outdated dependencies in the official Jekyll Docker image. On the other hand, Zola is modern, fast, has all the features I need, uses the Dart Sass compiler, has good support for creating and using themes (more on that later), and uses 🦀, which is the best lang on the planet (/s, sort of).\nNew Codebase\nThe other major change is that the “Home”, “Design Showcase”, and “Info” pages have been moved away from using the separate repo and codebase to being part of the same website; it’s confusing, so here’s a table of how it used to be:\nPageRepo\nHomepages\nInfopages\nWorkspages\nBlogblog-source\n\nNow everything is in the website repo, using the same stylesheet and templates:\nPageRepo\nHomewebsite\nInfowebsite\nWorkswebsite\nBlogwebsite\n\nLook and Feel\nAlmost every single style and template has been reworked, resulting in a much nicer look and feel, some that I can remember:\n\nBrand new navigation bar!\nPrimary color is now used to tint the background (bye boring gray!).\nCRT style is now used for ASCII, replacing the old “opaque to transparent gradient”.\nHeader styles have been reworked; they’re now thin, italic, and use JetBrains Mono with an alternative character set (ss02).\nQuotations and horizontal rules now have slightly rounded corners.\nCode blocks now use Solarized syntax highlighting theme instead of GitHub’s; it changes from light to dark variant depending on current color scheme.\nSource Code Pro font is now used for code blocks instead of system one.\nNew, animated 404 image.\nTags are now displayed next to the date, both in the post list and in the post itself. Check out this neat effect on hover!\nPosts can now be filtered by a tag, e.g you can filter only posts containing the Devlog tag.\nNew post navigation (previous/next post links at the end of the post).\nAnd more! (initial migration commit, ~2500 changes!).\n\nReborn Duckquill\nNow to the Duckquill, it’s been transformed from a Jekyll template to a proper Zola theme, the good thing about themes is that you can easily update and non-destructively tweak them by overriding some configuration variables and files.\nDuckquill powers this website, but can be used by anyone, although I use some additional styles unique to this website.\nIt’s listed on the Zola themes page, of which I’m quite proud of ^^\nConclusion\nIt’s been an interesting journey for sure; trying to use Hugo, losing my mind, regretting life choices, learning new SSG, burning out, coming back, learning Sass, HTML, and Tera (a bit like Liquid), procrastinating, coming back, rewriting half of the styles, and finally submitting the theme to the Zola themes website (not exactly in that order). All this, in my opinion, was worth it.\nMy plan now is to write a few posts and focus less on the website, since it’s a wormhole I can’t leave.\nShout out to Hari Rana for helping to improve the accessibility of the site by pointing out contrast issues, as well as some style change suggestions!\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/website-rewrite-in-zola/","title":"Website 2.0"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/coffee/":{"body":"","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/coffee/","title":"Buy Me a Coffee"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/colophon/":{"body":"\n\tThis is the least fun page on this website.

I’ve tried adding it earlier but it didn’t work for some reason, likely because I’m a moron, but in any case now I don’t have to set the contrast color manually. I will backport this to Duckquill along with other changes later today (I hope so at least). Thanks Lea Verou for this neat trick. One thing I changed about it is made it use slight transparency if the contrast color is black, so it doesn’t look too ugly.

This made the site weight around 1MB, which isn’t a lot, but twice the 512KB limit, so I’ve made a tough decision and axed all the stamps and renamed the section on the homepage from “Bumps” to “Badges”. Sad, but I won’t get id of them entirely; I plan to move them to my spacehey (somehow, idk), feel free to friend me there btw.\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/bye-stamps/","title":"Bye Stamps"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/content-duplication/":{"body":"You know, I want to make the Neocities site its own thing; with different content, style, vibe, and whatnot, but in order for it to be somewhat useful, I have to duplicate content from this site, which is like the opposite of my goal . Of course I could just link to this site, but then, what’s the point of having an alt site in the first place?

This time I have shortened homepage by moving unnecessary info to about page, which I have got rid of a while ago, and redesigned the works section (that window with rainbow text is now on about page).

I mean system fonts are neat and all, but it’s hard to maintain a consistent design considering that every OS and distro and user configuration uses different fonts. My choice was initially one of my favorite fonts, Inter, but it was too wide to my taste and I wanted something more condensed and cute. Cantarell fits this bill but it’s unmaintained; even GNOME plans to switch away from it. I then remembered about Vercel’s Geist family and thought why not give it a shot. And oh boy, it fits perfectly; it looks like something in between Cantarell and Inter, plus they provide both sans and mono variants which means they perfectly fit together. It’s also pretty compact; Geist Sans weights only 64kB, while Inter is 345kB. So yeah, I’m happy, although I have to toss away some more 88x31 buttons and stamps to fit the 512kb limit again…\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/geist-font/","title":"Geist Font"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/git-push/":{"body":"Testing something out, if everything works this post should be created and pushed to the website repo automatically by the nanolog tool.\nOr it’ll nuke the entire repo, idk.\n[7 edits omitted]\nEdit #7: Turned out I was using an old version of the script and didn’t properly export the GIT_DIR variable, hopefully it’ll work now.\nEdit #8: I hate Git so so much.\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/git-push/","title":"Git Push"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/i-m-alive/":{"body":"So uh yeah, I kinda forgot about this thing for a month, sorry.

I’ve got the idea of using Gum from Sam while they were working on Gir (very swag tool btw check it out). The idea is to make nanoposting easier and faster, thus reduce my Mastodon usage, thus having more control over my posts or something, I’ll write a post about this sometime.\nAnyhow, this post was written entirely from terminal using said tool; a bit tricky without spellchecking and having the edit area 6 line high, but could be worse. It doesn’t really make the process significantly faster, but why not make stuff more painful for no reason.\nNow that this post is written I can finally nanopost something else, as it was stopping me from doing so.\nP.S. Here’s a short demo:\n\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/nanolog-cli/","title":"Nanolog CLI"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/navigation-sidebar/":{"body":"So, there’s this thing I’ve been working on for five days straight: Navigation sidebar!\nThat’s right, I have finally fixed site’s navigation. The thing that was used for a short period of time before this was honestly pretty pad; to go somewhere you had to open the burger menu and then click, it covered content on mobile, and some links were in the footer (for some reason?). Now it’s all neatly placed in a sidebar, with categories, icons, all that stuff. It was surprisingly hard to implement, not the sidebar itself, no no, fixing all the stuff that relied on screen width such as post banners; I had to use some modern CSS features such as container queries as it wasn’t possible to fix them otherwise. I have also burnt down the “Rizz it Up” button on home page, it had to be done anyway.\nWhile at it I have also redesigned the footer, moved post buttons such as “Table of Contents” and “Share” over to header, and on pages that have an Atom feed it displays button to subscribe to it. The title in heading acts as “Go to Top” button, minor detail but pretty useful at times.\nThere’s still a lot of stuff to clean up and simplify, but whatever I have at hand already is times better than what was before. I’m particularly not happy with the search bar taking a lot of space, and search results being very narrow.\nEven thought sidebar is not a new concept, it’s worth noting that I got the idea to implement it by first looking at old Volpeon’s site, and was then convinced by looking at Pebble’s site (both look spectacular by the way).\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/navigation-sidebar/","title":"Navigation Sidebar"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/on-source-code/":{"body":"Forgot to mention, site’s source code has been, well, nuked. Codeberg introduced new repo size limits, basically personal repos that don’t really benefit anyone will be limited to just 100MB, and since mine weights twice as much, I had to move it somewhere else, aka private GitHub repo. It’ll be the case until I figure things out, but yeah, I didn’t want to risc it since the Codeberg changes will take effect starting tomorrow.\nI know I said this on Discord and Bluesky already, but it’s a pretty important change so an entry in nanolog wouldn’t hurt.\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/on-source-code/","title":"On Source Code"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/overhauling-neocities/":{"body":"Guess who’s writing this at 4AM.\nI’ve started porting my Neocities site to Zola; it works already (it took me like 5min), but it’ll take much more time to make it actually clean and pleasant to use, as right now it’s a hot mess of ugly HTML and confusing CSS. I have some grand (not actually) plans for it, so yeah, stay tuned.\n","id":"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/overhauling-neocities/","title":"Overhauling Neocities"},"https://widowmaker2025.github.io/nanolog/proper-categories/":{"body":"I’ve finally finished working on the categories feature, and if you’re reading this it means it’s already deployed. Not that it was difficult in terms of coding, but it was a bit tricky in terms of design, plus it was unclear how to integrate it properly.\nBasically I had some sort of categorization using tags and “post types” such as “Featured” and “Hot”, and while it sounds okay on the surface, it really wasn’t that good; there were no way to filter posts by their type, and the styling was a bit over the top and rather distracting.\nSo, to address these issues, I have added categories page. Under the hood it uses the same logic as tags, but my plan is to use only one category per post. I have also added feed links next to headings, so that you can subscribe to, I don’t know, “Archived” category and get ancient posts only, or subscribe to “Devlog” tag to get my site updates, you got the idea.\nI like how I managed to reuse existing styling from post list for the categories index page, and it wasn’t really my plan; I initially wanted it to use a unique and interesting style, but I just couldn’t come up with anything so I reused existing design (which I stole from Fuwari).\nWhat’s now left to finalize the categorization overhaul is redesign the “Tags” page, but right now I’m not sure how it should look like.\nP.S.

Not only the font itself is gorgerous, the site itself is spectacular too, which is no surprise considering it’s made by the same person that made Phosphor Icons website; Tobias.

It’s such a great icon library and it’s exactly what I needed for Ametrine, however it’s paid, so I’ll continue using Phosphor Icons, they’re great too.\nAnd after writing the above chunk of text, I’ve read nobody cares, I forgot how I came across it, but yeah, it really does suck that many people really just don’t care :&lt;\nP.S.
