	&lt;p&gt;It was quite hard to get the expressions right, &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daudix&#x2F;daudix.one&#x2F;blob&#x2F;6fe0769435516a0b3a4818592a8d5ab47d7b3db4&#x2F;content&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;header.png&quot;&gt;first version&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had them very sadge, so I changed them to be a bit more restrained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;backstory&quot;&gt;Backstory&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;macboy-chronicles&#x2F;&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, my previous laptop passed away recently and I got a new one to replace it. I teased that I would tell more about it in the next post, and well, this is that post :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clears throat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; alright, where did we stop last time… &lt;em&gt;paper noises&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, aha!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning the unneeded parts, we got back $110, which was a good starting point for saving up for the next laptop. Why a laptop and not a PC? As silly as it sounds, I simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sit in the same spot for longer than 10 minutes, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; if that spot is a desk, so a laptop is a requirement, not a choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boring money saving later, we (me, Mom, and later on Dad) started the search. Initially, we searched for ThinkPads since &lt;del&gt;ThinkPad cult members&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; people say they are very durable, upgradable, have good Linux support, and overall they are the best thing in the world (to be fair they do look badass).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few listings and some &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&quot;&gt;Notebookcheck&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; review reading later, it became clear that virtually all ThinkPads in the desired price category (~$210) suffer from the same issue: sRGB coverage around 56%. This isn’t a big deal if the only thing you do is write reports in Microsoft Word and scroll through Facebook memes, but it’s crucial if you do even basic design work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to look at Dell; my Mom had a Dell laptop before and it was a good machine. After scrolling through all listings from our city and checking every single one of them on Notebookcheck for the sRGB coverage, it became clear that the situation was somewhat similar to ThinkPads, but there was one listing that was interesting… (I’ve skipped the boring false positives).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell Latitude E7470 - 2017 ultrabook in great condition, with decent specs, and, most importantly, 96% sRGB coverage (at least so I thought)! MacBoy had full sRGB coverage, but still, it was very close, and comparing it to other laptops with 56% coverage it was the best variant. The price was sane as well: $230.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;latitude-closed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Latitude closed.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Feels good to hold a laptop that is twice as thin and light as MacBoy&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;latitude-open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Latitude open.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Even though its screen is 14 inches it&#x27;s just as compact as MacBoy; thin bezels compensate the screen size&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-s-time&quot;&gt;It’s Time&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day - 5th of June - while I was asleep, Mom told Dad about this variant, and he promptly called the seller to not miss such an opportunity. He asked if the machine in the listing was the same one, and it was indeed the same machine and all was OK, so he agreed on the purchase and delivery (which was free) the same day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up only to hear the surprising like snow-in-the-summer news, and I was happy and nervous at the same time—hapvous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours of painful sociophobic waiting later, the seller finally called me (since Dad already went to work) that he was on the way and would arrive within an hour. An hour later he called me again to say he had arrived at our place. I went out, took a deep breath, took the briefcase with the laptop from the seller’s car trunk, opened it, took out the laptop, opened it, gave it a quick glance just to make sure it wasn’t an empty chassis or in an unacceptable state (I was super nervous so I didn’t even check if the model was the right one), said “y-yeah all good, hopefully”, gave the money and &lt;del&gt;rushed&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; headed home at a steady pace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being excited, I turned the laptop on, disgusted by Windows and its awful design, scrolling, ads in the start menu—&lt;em&gt;distant cough&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; oh yeah, I got a little carried away. I went to YouTube and searched for “Costa Rica HDR” and turned &lt;em&gt;that one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; video on, doing the same on Mom’s Sony Vaio that I used for the last year. And something unexpected happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-fly-in-the-ointment&quot;&gt;A Fly in the Ointment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ready? &lt;em&gt;sighs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; The screen turned out to be dogshit. Yes, the very reason why I dismissed all the nice ThinkPads and Dells. I mean, I’m grateful and all, but it’s not even close to 96% sRGB; heck, it’s even slightly less saturated than the bootleg replacement screen on said Sony Vaio!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed and saddened, another “yes, but-” moment, all the searching was pointless as I could’ve got the first powerful ThinkPad for the same price, since the screen is the same level shit anyways, but it was late for the smart thoughts, so I just went along with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial detail that I didn’t give enough attention to is the fact that the Latitude in Notebookcheck was the high-end configuration; with the 4K touch screen, fingerprint scanner, and Intel Core i7 instead of i5 like in my unit. For some reason, I thought that the only difference between the touch 4K version and the FHD matte screen version was the resolution and the absence of, you know, the touch, but no, only the touch screen version has good color accuracy. The ones with matte screens (1920x1080 and 1366x768) have a generic sRGB coverage for this type of laptop - 50-something percent (for some reason there’s virtually no reviews for these versions, so no exact numbers). My ignorance has played a bad trick against me once again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered that closing the lid doesn’t put it in sleep mode. I thought it was a Windows issue, so I didn’t give it much attention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad things aside, I flashed a new Fedora Silverblue USB and installed it, which was an absolute breeze; no need to install &lt;code&gt;broadcom-wl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to get the WiFi working, no need for RPM Fusion for &lt;code&gt;broadcom-wl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and all the trickery needed to enable it on Silverblue, no need to add &lt;code&gt;acpi_backlight=auto&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; kernel argument to make the minimal screen brightness not burn your eyes, everything “just worked” out of the box. I knew Dell shipped some laptops with Linux and they’re (way) more Linux-friendly than Apple, but damn, I didn’t expect it to be this good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;neowofetch.png#transparent&quot; alt=&quot;neowofetch.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;How can one talk about a new laptop with Linux installed and not show a &lt;del&gt;neofetch&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; neowofetch screenshot!?&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation, I opened Software to update the system, and… BIOS AND FIRMWARE UPDATES!? Fwupd is good huh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I opened Settings to check the Device Security tab, just for fun and giggles, and IT’S ALL GREEN!? On MacBoy it was all red, since no secure boot and such.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;device-security.png#transparent&quot; alt=&quot;Device security.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to watch some videos, connected the headphones and A HEADPHONE TYPE SELECTOR POPPED OUT!? MacBoy didn’t have this as well, it was a headset all the time. Here, on the other hand, I can connect it as headphones, a headset, or just a microphone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-that-latitude&#x2F;audio-device-selector.png&quot; alt=&quot;Audio device selector.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used it for hours moving data from Vaio and MacBoy, and the battery didn’t drain. I can do 3 hours of work and watch some YouTube videos and it will still have 20% left. I still can’t get used to it after two weeks, it feels so good after the absence of battery and constant issues with the charger.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard has a longer travel distance than MacBoy and doesn’t have the slight key drift that makes keys make an annoying sound. It feels so good to write blog posts on it. The touchpad is decent as well, not the same glass trackpad though, it has a bit harsh scrolling (in the sense that it doesn’t scroll pixel by pixel but rather 2-3 pixels at a time) and it doesn’t click, meaning I need to either tap to click or use the dedicated buttons, which are present on both top and bottom of the touchpad at least. It still annoys me a little even 2 weeks later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One brand new thing for me was the trackpoint. This thing was so weird and confusing at first, but I slowly started to get it. It’s super useful in Blender and, to my surprise, Portal 2 :3&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these little things made my mood better and I no longer regretted the purchase. Sure, the screen wasn’t the one I wanted, sleep on closed lid doesn’t work since apparently the bezel was replaced and the magnet in it is absent and there’s no “Dell” typed on it, soft touch plastic collects all the dust and fingerprints by just looking at it and is constantly sticky no matter what you do, but it’s not critical.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; this laptop. MacBoy was a good machine, but this one is a whole new level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. While making the final edits to this post I’ve come up with a name for Latitude - Latte!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. The next post is already in the drafts, and it will be about my switch to a dumbphone or how my Pixel 3 burned violently without warning. (You can never have too many stories about my devices dying, right?)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>MacBoy Chronicles: The Complete Edition</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>widowmaker2025</author>

          <description xml:base="https://widowmaker2025.github.io/blog/macboy-chronicles/">&lt;p&gt;Today’s that time of the year called WWDC, so I thought it’s a perfect opportunity to publish this longstanding draft about my MacBook. Enjoy the roller-coaster!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bigmac-era&quot;&gt;The BigMac Era&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;backstory&quot;&gt;Backstory&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a chonky 15-inch MacBook Pro, but friends simply called him BigMac. He was manufactured in 2011 and was happy to be a MacBook running macOS, up until one day, when Apple betrayed him and stopped providing him with updates.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, he was stuck with macOS High Sierra. He thought this was the end, that he would never see the night mode introduced in Mojave, nor the big icon redesign of Big Sur. Hell, he wouldn’t even get any security updates anymore! All he had to do was wait for the unavoidable death.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something outrageous happened one day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was put on sale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I AM BEING SOLD!?” he exclaimed, but no answer followed, as he’s just a silly BigMac that cannot speak.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did he know what was about to happen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-chance&quot;&gt;Second Chance&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passed, people asked about him, but in the end, no one bought him. He lost all hope of ever being useful again, until one day, someone called the seller for details. He didn’t hope this would lead to anything, but surprisingly, it did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few days, BigMac’s owner arrived at our place. My dad and I asked some things about him, turned him on, and checked some basic things like the system info window, webcam, and charger, but nothing more, since it was our first encounter with such a machine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promptly, we agreed on the price and he was ours. BigMac was shocked by all this; did he just regain his purpose? I showed him off to the rest of the family, played some YouTube videos to see how good the screen and speakers were. I was super happy that day, and so was BigMac.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;plans-change&quot;&gt;Plans Change&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day, I realized the problem with High Sierra: it’s an old version and BigMac doesn’t receive updates anymore. After some quick googling, I found out about something called macOS patchers. An hour later, I had a USB stick with macOS Mojave in hand. I booted BigMac into it, installed Mojave only to discover an issue: his GPU was malfunctioning. A quick lookup revealed it was a common and expensive issue to fix. So the next day, the previous owner and my dad agreed on returning the device without any change in price, and it was returned the same day. Fortunately, all went smoothly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BigMac’s history is unknown beyond this point. Hopefully, he became useful to someone in one form or another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-macboy-era&quot;&gt;The MacBoy Era&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-life&quot;&gt;New Life&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a small 13-inch MacBook Pro, but friends simply called him MacBoy. The story begins the same way as &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;macboy-chronicles&#x2F;#backstory&quot;&gt;BigMac’s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but the difference starts at the point of purchase.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad and I arrived at MacBoy’s owner’s place, checked the same things as when BigMac was purchased: system info window, webcam, and charger. After agreeing on the price and coming home, flashing a patched Mojave USB and installing it, the journey continued.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;macboy-chronicles&#x2F;macbook-sell-photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook sell photo.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the photos I took when I tried to sell it at some point XD&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;widowmaker2025.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;macboy-chronicles&#x2F;macbook-high-sierra.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook High Sierra.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Ditto but with the screen on displaying the system info&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacBoy was shocked: “Did I not just become useful again, but also become up-to-date again? My sensors aren’t lying?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, in fact, real. I was incredibly happy to have a new friend, and so was MacBoy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passed, macOS Catalina was released, and it was time for an upgrade. I repeated the same steps as when I installed Mojave. It had some glitches here and there, but otherwise, it was perfectly usable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tea-is-an-enemy&quot;&gt;Tea Is an Enemy&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, an accident happened: I was working and somehow got into an argument with my little brother, in which he pushed me while I was sipping some sweet tea… MacBoy got soaked. Quickly, I turned it off and sideways for the tea to come out, then put some towels on the keyboard and placed it upside down. When it dried, fortunately, it was working, but the keyboard was, y’know, all sugary and not quite functional.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying to clean it without much success, we (my dad and I) went for a replacement. While at the parts shop, we got some upgrades for it: an optibay (a thingy that goes in place of the CD-ROM that allows putting a regular SATA drive in it) and an SSD. At home, I replaced the keyboard, with some struggle but still, upgrades were installed, and it was working like a charm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebirth&quot;&gt;Rebirth&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Big Sur came out. I, of course, tried to perform the same trick only to find out that it worked horribly slow, had &lt;em&gt;all kinds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of graphics glitches, things like iMessage didn’t work at all, and overall, it was a horrible experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Catalina it was again. But then I remembered watching some videos about some OS that allowed nice customization, like you could make windows act like jelly and all that. So I found these videos and turned out that OS was Manjaro. Fast forward some time, I flashed a USB stick with Manjaro and installed it on MacBoy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacBoy was shocked, “What the hell is this thing? It doesn’t look anything like my parent company’s OS,” he thought. Moments later, Manjaro was installing, and half an hour later, the installation was complete.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick reboot, MacBoy was shocked to find himself so snappy and fresh, almost like he was a whole new computer. He was used like that for some time until some weird fullscreen glitch appeared and MacBoy was beeping at the same time, so I reinstalled it and looked for a different distro, since this shit scared the living hell out of me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then “distro-hopped”—changed the Linux distribution in search of the right one. Some of them were Ubuntu (the one with the hairy hippopotamus), EndeavourOS, Arch, Cloud Ready (ChromeOS), elementaryOS, Linux Mint, Manjaro, and Fedora. In the process, a lot of data was lost, so from now on I make backups and am very cautious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice stopped on Fedora Workstation, as it provided a very clean desktop compared to the over-customized Ubuntu, was fast, and overall very nice, except for one problem (on first-ever install): Wi-Fi was not working. Quickly, MacBoy was connected to the network via Ethernet cable, and the long googling began.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was eventually found; it needed a &lt;code&gt;broadcom-wl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; driver, which required enabling the “RPM Fusion” repository for installation, which didn’t make any sense to me at the time. After unsuccessful attempts to enable it, I found one &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discussion.fedoraproject.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;sudo-dnf-install-broadcom-wl-problems&#x2F;77982&#x2F;3&quot;&gt;reply in Fedora forums&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; mentioning some script to enable RPM Fusion and install &lt;code&gt;broadcom-wl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. It seemed like a solution, and it even worked somehow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was good now; MacBoy and I were happy to be together again, without the bad influence of his parent company. Time passed, new Fedora versions came out, I distro-hopped more, but every time returned to Fedora, migrated from Workstation to Silverblue, learned more about FOSS, and even started contributing translations and later on, even icons. But everything good comes to an end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;For some reason I decided to try ChromeOS, yes it was pure dogshit, even the Linux container didn&#x27;t work&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charger started acting up: heating, sparking, and not charging. No wonder, it was in an awful state, tape made the rubber decompose entirely. It was clear that it was time for it to be replaced, but the financial situation didn’t quite allow it, so what was left to do was to improvise. First, I knocked the charger a bit to make the pins come out, then sandpapered some metal from the MagSafe connector for the pins to be closer to the MagSafe connector. The issue, by the way, was in the connector pins; they were stuck inside since the spring forcing them outside became very loose or even broke.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The last charger &quot;repair&quot;, all serious this time, we even got this thermal thingy!&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used it in this hacky way for a while. It was an unpleasant experience, but there’s so much you can do in such a situation: constantly reconnecting the charger, pulling out the pins, sandpapering more and more metal from the connector. Then the unavoidable happened, it finally died.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The start of my webdev learning, well, one of the unsuccessful attempts&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacBoy was put in a drawer until better times when a new charger could be bought. In the meantime, I used my mom’s laptop to not lose access to a computer entirely.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came, a new charger was bought, and MacBoy was finally working again, but not for long. Very soon, he stopped charging. Since the charger was new, the suspicion fell on the battery, so I used it by powering it on without the battery by disconnecting the charger, holding the power button for 5 seconds, and, while holding it, connecting the charger and then releasing the power button after 5 seconds. Half a year later, a new charger was purchased. All this time, I used my mom’s laptop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charger worked a single day and then stopped charging. After a month or so, some budget to go to the repair shop was available and we went there, showed the problem and—WAIT IT WORKS, WTF!? Yep, it does; “I will shove the old battery up Satan’s ass,” I thought. To not lose time on nothing, we replaced the noisy fan that became noisy in the period of waiting for a new charger, the broken HDD cable that unexpectedly died one day, and repasted the CPU. Then we went back home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I used my mom’s laptop for a while, I decided to reinstall Silverblue on MacBoy for it to be clean, then I moved the data back, and started using it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONLY FOR IT TO STOP CHARGING, &lt;em&gt;AGAIN!!!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that I was sad is like saying nothing. I was absolutely crushed knowing that we’re not in the best financial situation and that fucker kept sucking the family’s money and my soul.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, we went to the repair shop once again (of course after a while), and this time requested them to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; perform the full diagnosis to know why it doesn’t fucking charge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days passed, no call from the repair shop, so Dad called first. The answer followed:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh yeah, so I don’t really know where exactly the issue is, but I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that it’s the power controller. I can replace it, but it’s &lt;strong&gt;dangerous&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and there will be a 30% chance that the motherboard will burn afterward. So yeah, it’s up to you to decide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day (or the next-next day, I don’t remember), we went there to take it since that’s not an answer one wants to hear. Like, what the hell does it mean there’s a 30% chance of failure?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repairman wasn’t even at the shop when we arrived, so his coworker assembled MacBoy (yes, it was freaking disassembled) and gave it to us, asking if we would like him to see MacBoy instead but it would require 2-3 more days. Of course, we declined this offer; they had 10 days and still didn’t even assemble it, and it was super dirty on top of that, really showing the level of “care” they put into the repair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still there (on a street filled to the brim with repair shops), we started searching for a different Mac repair shop. A lot of stores pointed to a shop of one talented man that does Mac repairs; “best in town.” We went there, described our issue, and he immediately tried to fix it by resoldering the power controller (the one that the previous repair shop said would have a failure chance if resoldered), but unfortunately, it didn’t help. So he asked us to leave it for a few days since a more in-depth diagnosis needs time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, no call from the repair shop, so Dad once again called first. The answer:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I tried everything, but no luck. Sorry man. I’m quite certain that the motherboard is dead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooo we went and took it back. Since it was clear that trying further was pointless, we decided to return some of the parts from earlier visits; after all, they were only used for a few days at best. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of arguing later, we agreed on returning the charger, HDD cable, fan, and battery for half the price we bought them for, so we got back ~$110 in total. It was a good deal and a good start for saving up for a new laptop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still there, we checked all the nearby stores if they would like to buy it for parts. No one did, unfortunately (or fortunately).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long and interesting journey, but everything comes to an end. MacBoy was put in a drawer until better times when we can get another same MacBook and take the motherboard from it and put it in MacBoy, resulting in a FrankenBook. Until then, the story ends here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Current state, it turns on for a few minutes using the direct power method and old charger, but that&#x27;s about it&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; GOTCHA! It doesn’t. We already got the new laptop, more on that in the next post. Stay tuned!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
